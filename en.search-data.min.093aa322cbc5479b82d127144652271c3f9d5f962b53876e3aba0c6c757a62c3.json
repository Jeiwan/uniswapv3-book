ETH will be the $x$ reserve, USDC will be the $y$ reserve. We\u0026rsquo;ll set the current price to 5000 USDC per 1 ETH. The range we\u0026rsquo;ll provide liquidity into is 4545-5500 USDC per 1 ETH. We\u0026rsquo;ll buy some ETH from the pool. At this point, since we have only one price range, we want the price of the trade to stay within the price range.  Visually, this model looks like this:\nBefore getting to code, let\u0026rsquo;s figure out the math and calculate all the parameters of the model. To keep things simple, I\u0026rsquo;ll do math calculations in Python before implementing them in Solidity. This will allow us to focus on the math without diving into the nuances of math in Solidity. This also means that, in smart contracts, we\u0026rsquo;ll hardcode all the amounts.

Introduction","content":"Introduction to markets #  How centralized exchanges work #  In this book, we\u0026rsquo;ll build a decentralized exchange (DEX) that will run on Ethereum. There\u0026rsquo;re multiple approaches to how an exchange can be designed. All centralized exchanges have an order book at their core. An order book is just a journal that stores all sell and buy orders that traders want to make. Each order in this book contains a price the order must be executed at and the amount that must be bought or sold.\nFor trading to happen, there must exist liquidity, which is simply the availability of assets on a market. If you want to buy a wardrobe but no one is selling one, there\u0026rsquo;s no liquidity. If you want to sell a wardrobe but no one wants to buy it, there\u0026rsquo;s liquidity but no buyers. If there\u0026rsquo;s no liquidity, there\u0026rsquo;s nothing to buy or sell.\nOn centralized exchanges, the order book is where liquidity is accumulated. If someone places a sell order, they provide liquidity to the market. If someone places a buy order, they expected the market to have liquidity, otherwise, no trade is possible.\nWhen there\u0026rsquo;s no liquidity, but markets are still interested in trades, market makers come into play. A market maker is a firm or an individual who provides liquidity to markets, that is someone who has a lot of money and who buys different assets to sell them on exchanges. For this job market makers are paid by exchanges. Market makers make money on providing liquidity to exchanges.\nHow decentralized exchanges work #  Don\u0026rsquo;t be surprised, decentralized exchanges also need liquidity. And they also need someone who provides it to traders of a wide variety of assets. However, this process cannot be handled in a centralized way. A decentralized solution must be found. There are multiple decentralized solutions and some of them are implemented differently. Our focus will be on how Uniswap solves this problem.\nAutomated Market Makers #  The evolution of on-chain markets brought us to the idea of Automated Market Makers (AMM). As the name implies, this algorithm works exactly like market makers but in an automated way. Moreover, it\u0026rsquo;s decentralized and permissionless, that is:\n it\u0026rsquo;s not governed by a single entity; all assets are not stored in one place; anyone can use it from anywhere.  What is an AMM? #  An AMM is a set of smart contracts that define how liquidity is managed. Each trading pair (e.g. ETH/USDC) is a separate contract that stores both ETH and USDC and that\u0026rsquo;s programmed to mediate trades: exchanging ETH for USDC and vice versa.\nThe core idea is pooling: each contract is a pool that stores liquidity let\u0026rsquo;s different users (including other smart contract) to trade in a permissioned way. There are two roles, liquidity providers and traders, and these roles interact with each other through pools of liquidity, and the way they can interact with pools is programmed and immutable.\nWhat makes this approach different from centralized exchanges is that the smart contracts are fully automated and not managed by anyone. There are no managers, admins, privileged users, etc. There are only liquidity providers and traders (they can be the same people), and all the algorithms are programmed, immutable, and public.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s now look closer at how Uniswap implements an AMM.\n Please note that I use pool and pair terms interchangeably throughout the book because a Uniswap pool is a pair of two tokens.\n  If you have any questions feel free asking them in the GitHub Discussion of this milestone!\n "},{"id":7,"href":"/docs/milestone_1/calculating-liquidity/","title":"Calculating Liquidity","section":"Milestone 1.

Here\u0026rsquo;s what we need to know to add liquidity to the pool contract:\n A price range. As a liquidity provider, we want to provide liquidity at a specific price range, and it\u0026rsquo;ll only be used in this range. Amount of liquidity, which is the amounts of two tokens. We\u0026rsquo;ll need to transfer these amounts to the pool contract.  Here, we\u0026rsquo;re going to calculate these manually, but, in a later chapter, a contract will do this for us. Let\u0026rsquo;s begin with a price range.\nPrice Range Calculation #  Recall that, in Uniswap V3, the entire price range is demarcated into ticks: each tick corresponds to a price and has an index. In our first pool implementation, we\u0026rsquo;re going to buy ETH for USDC at the price of $5000 per 1 ETH. Buying ETH will remove some amount of it from the pool and will push the price slightly above $5000. We want to provide liquidity at a range that includes this price. And we want to be sure that the final price will stay within this range (we\u0026rsquo;ll do multi-range swaps in a later milestone).\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll need to find three ticks:\n The current tick will correspond to the current price (5000 USDC for 1 ETH). The lower and upper bounds of the price range we\u0026rsquo;re providing liquidity into. Let the lower price be $4545 and the upper price be $5500.  From the theoretical introduction we know that:\n$$\\sqrt{P} = \\sqrt{\\frac{y}{x}}$$\nSince we\u0026rsquo;ve agreed to use ETH as the $x$ reserve and USDC as the $y$ reserve, the prices at each of the ticks are:\n$$\\sqrt{P_c} = \\sqrt{\\frac{5000}{1}} = \\sqrt{5000} \\approx 70.71$$\n$$\\sqrt{P_l} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4545}{1}} \\approx 67.42$$\n$$\\sqrt{P_u} = \\sqrt{\\frac{5500}{1}} \\approx 74.16$$\nWhere $P_c$ is the current price, $P_l$ is the lower bound of the range, $P_u$ is the upper bound of the range.\nNow, we can find corresponding ticks. We know that prices and ticks are connected via this formula:\n$$\\sqrt{P(i)}=1.0001^{\\frac{i}{2}}$$\nThus, we can find tick $i$ via:\n$$i = log_{\\sqrt{1.0001}} \\sqrt{P(i)}$$\n The square roots in this formula cancel out, but since we\u0026rsquo;re working with $\\sqrt{p}$ we need to preserve them.\n Let\u0026rsquo;s find the ticks:\n Current tick: $i_c = log_{\\sqrt{1.0001}} 70.71 = 85176$ Lower tick: $i_l = log_{\\sqrt{1.0001}} 67.42 = 84222$ Upper tick: $i_u = log_{\\sqrt{1.0001}} 74.16 = 86129$   To calculate these, I used Python:\nimport math  def price_to_tick(p):  return math.floor(math.log(p, 1.0001))  price_to_tick(5000) \u0026gt; 85176  That\u0026rsquo;s it for price range calculation!\nLast thing to note here is that Uniswap uses Q64.96 number to store $\\sqrt{P}$. This is a fixed point number that has 64 bits for the integer part and 96 bits for the fractional part. In our above calculations, prices are floating point numbers: 70.71, 67.42, 74.16. We need to convert them to Q64.96. Luckily, this is simple: we need to multiply the numbers by the maximum value of the fractional part of Q64.96, which is $2^{96}$. We\u0026rsquo;ll get:\n$$\\sqrt{P_c} = 5602277097478614198912276234240$$\n$$\\sqrt{P_l} = 5314786713428871004159001755648$$\n$$\\sqrt{P_u} = 5875717789736564987741329162240$$\n In Python:\nq96 = 2**96 def price_to_sqrtp(p):  return int(math.sqrt(p) * q96)  price_to_sqrtp(5000) \u0026gt; 5602277097478614198912276234240 Notice that we\u0026rsquo;re multiplying before converting to integer. Otherwise, we\u0026rsquo;ll lose precision.\n Token Amounts Calculation #  Next step is to decide how many tokens we want to deposit into the pool. The answer is: as many as we want. The amounts are not strictly defined, we can deposit as much as it is enough to buy a small amount of ETH without making the current price leave the price range we put liquidity into. During development and testing we\u0026rsquo;ll be able to mint any amount of tokens, so getting the amounts we want is not a problem.\nFor our first swap, let\u0026rsquo;s deposit 1 ETH and 5000 USDC.\n Recall that the proportion of current pool reserves tells the current spot price. So if we want to put more tokens into the pool and keep the same price, the amounts must be proportional, e.g.: 2 ETH and 10,000 USDC; 10 ETH and 50,000 USDC, etc.\n Liquidity Amount Calculation #  Next, we need to calculate $L$ based on the amounts we\u0026rsquo;ll deposit. This is a tricky part, so hold tight!\nFrom the theoretical introduction, you remember that: $$L = \\sqrt{xy}$$\nHowever, this formula is for the infinite curve 🙂 But we want to put liquidity into a limited price range, which is just a segment of that infinite curve. We need to calculate $L$ specifically for the price range we\u0026rsquo;re going to deposit liquidity into. We need some more advanced calculations.\nTo calculate $L$ for a price range, let\u0026rsquo;s look at one interesting fact we have discussed earlier: price ranges can be depleted. It\u0026rsquo;s absolutely possible to buy the entire amount of one token from a price range and leave the pool with only the other token.\nAt the points $a$ and $b$, there\u0026rsquo;s only one token in the range: ETH at the point $a$ and USDC at the point $b$.\nThat being said, we want to find an $L$ that will allow the price to move to either of the points. We want enough liquidity for the price to reach either of the boundaries of a price range. Thus, we want $L$ to be calculated based on the maximum amounts of $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta y$.\nNow, let\u0026rsquo;s see what the prices are at the edges. When ETH is bought from a pool, the price is growing; when USDC is bought, the price is falling. Recall that the price is $\\frac{y}{x}$. So, at the point $a$, the price is lowest of the range; at the point $b$, the price is highest.\n In fact, prices are not defined at these points because there\u0026rsquo;s only one reserve in the pool, but what we need to understand here is that the price around the point $b$ is higher than the start price, and the price at the point $a$ is lower than the start price.\n Now, break the curve from the image above into two segments: one to the left of the start point and one to the right of the start point. We\u0026rsquo;re going to calculate two $L$\u0026rsquo;s, one for each of the segments. Why? Because each of the two tokens of a pool contributes to either of the segments: the left segment is made entirely of token $x$, the right segment is made entirely of token $y$. This comes from the fact that, during swapping, the price moves in either direction: it\u0026rsquo;s either growing or falling. For the price to move, only either of the tokens is needed:\n when the price is growing, only token $x$ is needed for the swap (we\u0026rsquo;re buying token $x$, so we want to take only token $x$ from the pool); when the price is falling, only token $y$ is needed for the swap.  Thus, the liquidity in the segment of the curve to the left of the current price consists only of token $x$ and is calculated only from the amount of token $x$ provided. And, similarly, the liquidity in the segment of the curve to the right of the current price consists only of token $y$ and is calculated only from the amount of token $y$ provided.\nThis is why, when providing liquidity, we calculate two $L$\u0026rsquo;s and pick one of them. Which one? The smaller one. Why? Because the bigger one already includes the smaller one! We want the new liquidity to be distributed evenly along the curve, thus we want to add the same $L$ to the left and to the right of the current price. If we pick the bigger one, the user would need to provide more liquidity to compensate the shortage in the smaller one. This is doable, of course, but this would make the smart contract more complex.\n What happens with the remainder of the bigger $L$? Well, nothing. After picking the smaller $L$ we can simply convert it to a smaller amount of the token that resulted in the bigger $L$–this will adjust it down. After that, we\u0026rsquo;ll have token amounts that will result in the same $L$.\n And the final detail I need to focus your attention on here is: new liquidity must not change the current price. That is, it must be proportional to the current proportion of the reserves. And this is why the two $L$\u0026rsquo;s can be different–when the proportion is not preserved. And we pick the small $L$ to reestablish the proportion.\nI hope this will make more sense after we implement this in code! Now, let\u0026rsquo;s look at the formulas.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s recall how $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta y$ are calculated:\n$$\\Delta x = \\Delta \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{P}} L$$ $$\\Delta y = \\Delta \\sqrt{P} L$$\nWe can expands these formulas by replacing the delta P\u0026rsquo;s with actual prices (we know them from the above):\n$$\\Delta x = (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{P_b}} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{P_c}}) L$$ $$\\Delta y = (\\sqrt{P_c} - \\sqrt{P_a}) L$$\n$P_a$ is the price at the point $a$, $P_b$ is the price at the point $b$, and $P_c$ is the current price (see the above chart). Notice that, since the price is calculated as $\\frac{y}{x}$ (i.e. it\u0026rsquo;s the price of $x$ in terms of $y$), the price at point $b$ is higher than the current price and the price at $a$. The price at $a$ is the lowest of the three.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s find the $L$ from the first formula:\n$$\\Delta x = (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{P_b}} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{P_c}}) L$$ $$\\Delta x = \\frac{L}{\\sqrt{P_b}} - \\frac{L}{\\sqrt{P_c}}$$ $$\\Delta x = \\frac{L(\\sqrt{P_b} - \\sqrt{P_c})}{\\sqrt{P_b} \\sqrt{P_c}}$$ $$L = \\Delta x \\frac{\\sqrt{P_b} \\sqrt{P_c}}{\\sqrt{P_b} - \\sqrt{P_c}}$$\nAnd from the second formula: $$\\Delta y = (\\sqrt{P_c} - \\sqrt{P_a}) L$$ $$L = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\sqrt{P_c} - \\sqrt{P_a}}$$\nSo, these are our two $L$\u0026rsquo;s, one for each of the segments:\n$$L = \\Delta x \\frac{\\sqrt{P_b} \\sqrt{P_c}}{\\sqrt{P_b} - \\sqrt{P_c}}$$ $$L = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\sqrt{P_c} - \\sqrt{P_a}}$$\nNow, let\u0026rsquo;s plug the prices we calculated earlier into them:\n$$L = \\Delta x \\frac{\\sqrt{P_b}\\sqrt{P_c}}{\\sqrt{P_b}-\\sqrt{P_c}} = 1 ETH * \\frac{67.42 * 70.71}{70.71 - 67.42}$$ After converting to Q64.96, we get:\n$$L = 1519437308014769733632$$\nAnd for the other $L$: $$L = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\sqrt{P_c}-\\sqrt{P_a}} = \\frac{5000USDC}{74.16-70.71}$$ $$L = 1517882343751509868544$$\nOf these two, we\u0026rsquo;ll pick the smaller one.\n In Python:\nsqrtp_low = price_to_sqrtp(4545) sqrtp_cur = price_to_sqrtp(5000) sqrtp_upp = price_to_sqrtp(5500)  def liquidity0(amount, pa, pb):  if pa \u0026gt; pb:  pa, pb = pb, pa  return (amount * (pa * pb) / q96) / (pb - pa)  def liquidity1(amount, pa, pb):  if pa \u0026gt; pb:  pa, pb = pb, pa  return amount * q96 / (pb - pa)  liq0 = liquidity0(amount_eth, sqrtp_cur, sqrtp_upp) liq1 = liquidity1(amount_usdc, sqrtp_cur, sqrtp_low) liq = int(min(liq0, liq1)) \u0026gt; 1517882343751509868544  Token Amounts Calculation, Again #  Since we choose the amounts we\u0026rsquo;re going to deposit, the amounts can be wrong. We cannot deposit any amounts at any price ranges; liquidity amount needs to be distributed evenly along the curve of the price range we\u0026rsquo;re depositing into. Thus, even though users choose amounts, the contract needs to re-calculate them, and actual amounts will be slightly different (at least because of rounding).\nLuckily, we already know the formulas:\n$$\\Delta x = \\frac{L(\\sqrt{P_b} - \\sqrt{P_c})}{\\sqrt{P_b} \\sqrt{P_c}}$$ $$\\Delta y = L(\\sqrt{P_c} - \\sqrt{P_a})$$\n In Python:\ndef calc_amount0(liq, pa, pb):  if pa \u0026gt; pb:  pa, pb = pb, pa  return int(liq * q96 * (pb - pa) / pa / pb)   def calc_amount1(liq, pa, pb):  if pa \u0026gt; pb:  pa, pb = pb, pa  return int(liq * (pb - pa) / q96)  amount0 = calc_amount0(liq, sqrtp_upp, sqrtp_cur) amount1 = calc_amount1(liq, sqrtp_low, sqrtp_cur) (amount0, amount1) \u0026gt; (998976618347425408, 5000000000000000000000) As you can see, the number are close to the amounts we want to provide, but ETH is slightly smaller.\n  Hint: use cast --from-wei AMOUNT to convert from wei to ether, e.g.:\ncast --from-wei 998976618347425280 will give you 0.998976618347425280.\n "},{"id":8,"href":"/docs/introduction/constant-function-market-maker/","title":"Constant Function Market Makers","section":"Milestone 0.

At its core is a very simple mathematical formula:\n$$x * y = k$$\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it, this is the AMM.\n$x$ and $y$ are pool contract reserves–the amounts of tokens it currently holds. k is just their product, actual value doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter.\n Why there are only two reserves, x and y?\nEach Uniswap pool can hold only two tokens. We use x and y to refer to reserves of one pool, where x is the reserve of the first token and y is the reserve of the other token, and the order doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter.\n The constant function formula says: after each trade, k must remain unchanged. When traders make trades, they put some amount of one token into a pool (the token they want to sell) and remove some amount of the other token from the pool (the token they want to buy). This changes the reserves of the pool, and the constant function formula says that the product of reserves must not change. As we will see many times in this book, this simple requirement is the core algorithm of how Uniswap works.\nThe trade function #  Now that we know what pools are, let\u0026rsquo;s write the formula of how trading happens in a pool:\n$$(x + r\\Delta x)(y - \\Delta y) = k$$\n There\u0026rsquo;s a pool with some amount of token 0 ($x$) and some amount of token 1 ($y$) When we buy token 1 for token 0, we give some amount of token 0 to the pool ($\\Delta x$). The pool gives us some amount of token 1 in exchange ($\\Delta y$). The pool also takes a small fee ($r$) from the amount of token 0 we gave. The reserve of token 0 changes ($x + r \\Delta x$), and the reserve of token 1 changes as well ($y - \\Delta y$). The product of updated reserves must still equal $k$.   We\u0026rsquo;ll use token 0 and token 1 notation for the tokens because this is how they\u0026rsquo;re referenced in the code. At this point, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter which of them is 0 and which is 1.\n We\u0026rsquo;re basically giving a pool some amount of token 0 and getting some amount of token 1. The job of the pool is to give us a correct amount of token 1 calculated at a fair price. This leads us to the following conclusion: pools decide what trade prices are.\nPricing #  How do we calculate the prices of tokens in a pool?\nSince Uniswap pools are separate smart contracts, tokens in a pool are priced in terms of each other. For example: in a ETH/USDC pool, ETH is priced in terms of USDC and USDC is priced in terms of ETH. If 1 ETH costs 1000 USDC, then 1 USDC costs 0.001 ETH. The same is true for any other pool, whether it\u0026rsquo;s a stablecoin pair or not (e.g. ETH/BTC).\nIn the real world, everything is priced based on the law of supply and demand. This also holds true for AMMs. We\u0026rsquo;ll put the demand part aside for now and focus on supply.\nThe prices of tokens in a pool are determined by the supply of the tokens, that is by the amounts of reserves of the tokens that the pool is holding. Token prices are simply relations of reserves:\n$$P_x = \\frac{y}{x}, \\quad P_y=\\frac{x}{y}$$\nWhere $P_x$ and $P_y$ are prices of tokens in terms of the other token.\nSuch prices are called spot prices and they only reflect current market prices. However, the actual price of a trade is calculated differently. And this is where we need to bring the demand part back.\nConcluding from the law of supply and demand, high demand increases the price–and this is a property we need to have in a permissionless system. We want the price to be high when demand is high, and we can use pool reserves to measure the demand: the more tokens you want to remove from a pool (relative to pool\u0026rsquo;s reserves), the higher the impact of demand is.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s return to the trade formula and look at it closer:\n$$(x + r\\Delta x)(y - \\Delta y) = xy$$\nAs you can see, we can derive $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta y$ from it, which means we can calculate the output amount of a trade based on the input amount and vice versa:\n$$\\Delta y = \\frac{yr\\Delta x}{x + r\\Delta x}$$ $$\\Delta x = \\frac{x \\Delta y}{r(y - \\Delta y)}$$\nIn fact, these formulas free us from calculating prices! We can always find the output amount using the $\\Delta y$ formula (when we want to sell a known amount of tokens) and we can always find the input amount using the $\\Delta x$ formula (when we want to buy a known amount of tokens). Notice that each of these formulas is a relation of reserves ($x/y$ or $y/x$) and they also take the trade amount ($\\Delta x$ in the former and $\\Delta y$ in the latter) into consideration. These are the pricing functions that respect both supply and demand. And we don\u0026rsquo;t even need to calculate the prices!\n Here\u0026rsquo;s how you can derive the above formulas from the trade function: $$(x + r\\Delta x)(y - \\Delta y) = xy$$ $$y - \\Delta y = \\frac{xy}{x + r\\Delta x}$$ $$-\\Delta y = \\frac{xy}{x + r\\Delta x} - y$$ $$-\\Delta y = \\frac{xy - y({x + r\\Delta x})}{x + r\\Delta x}$$ $$-\\Delta y = \\frac{xy - xy - y r \\Delta x}{x + r\\Delta x}$$ $$-\\Delta y = \\frac{- y r \\Delta x}{x + r\\Delta x}$$ $$\\Delta y = \\frac{y r \\Delta x}{x + r\\Delta x}$$ And: $$(x + r\\Delta x)(y - \\Delta y) = xy$$ $$x + r\\Delta x = \\frac{xy}{y - \\Delta y}$$ $$r\\Delta x = \\frac{xy}{y - \\Delta y} - x$$ $$r\\Delta x = \\frac{xy - x(y - \\Delta y)}{y - \\Delta y}$$ $$r\\Delta x = \\frac{xy - xy + x \\Delta y}{y - \\Delta y}$$ $$r\\Delta x = \\frac{x \\Delta y}{y - \\Delta y}$$ $$\\Delta x = \\frac{x \\Delta y}{r(y - \\Delta y)}$$\n The Curve #  The above calculations might seem too abstract and dry. Let\u0026rsquo;s visualize the constant product function to better understand how it works.\nWhen plotted, the constant product function is a quadratic hyperbola:\nWhere axes are the pool reserves. Every trade starts at the point on the curve that corresponds to the current ratio of reserves. To calculate the output amount, we need to find a new point on the curve, which has the $x$ coordinate of $x+\\Delta x$, i.e. current reserve of token 0 + the amount we\u0026rsquo;re selling. The change in $y$ is the amount of token 1 we\u0026rsquo;ll get.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look at a concrete example:\n The purple line is the curve, the axes are the reserves of a pool (notice that they\u0026rsquo;re equal at the start price). Start price is 1. We\u0026rsquo;re selling 200 of token 0. If we use only the start price, we expect to get 200 of token 1. However, the execution price is 0.666, so we get only 133.333 of token 1!  This example is from the Desmos chart made by Dan Robinson, one of the creators of Uniswap. To build a better intuition of how it works, try making up different scenarios and plotting them on the graph. Try different reserves, see how output amount changes when $\\Delta x$ is small relative to $x$.\n As the legend goes, Uniswap was invented in Desmos.\n I bet you\u0026rsquo;re wondering why using such a curve? It might seem like it punishes you for trading big amounts. This is true, and this is a desirable property! The law of supply and demand tells us that when demand is high (and supply is constant) the price is also high. And when demand is low, the price is also lower. This is how markets work. And, magically, the constant product function implements this mechanism! Demand is defined by the amount you want to buy, and supply is the pool reserves. When you want to buy a big amount relative to pool reserves the price is higher than when you want to buy a smaller amount. Such a simple formula guarantees such a powerful mechanism!\nEven though Uniswap doesn\u0026rsquo;t calculate trade prices, we can still see them on the curve. Surprisingly, there are multiple prices when making a trade:\n Before a trade, there\u0026rsquo;s a spot price. It\u0026rsquo;s equal to the relation of reserves, $y/x$ or $x/y$ depending on the direction of the trade. This price is also the slope of the tangent line at the starting point. After a trade, there\u0026rsquo;s a new spot price, at a different point on the curve. And it\u0026rsquo;s the slope of the tangent line at this new point. The actual price of the trade is the slope of the line connecting the two points!  And that\u0026rsquo;s the whole math of Uniswap! Phew!\nWell, this is the math of Uniswap V2, and we\u0026rsquo;re studying Uniswap V3. So in the next part, we\u0026rsquo;ll see how the mathematics of Uniswap V3 is different.\n"},{"id":9,"href":"/docs/milestone_3/different-ranges/","title":"Different Price Ranges","section":"Milestone 3.

That\u0026rsquo;s it: the design of Uniswap V3 allows liquidity provider to provide liquidity that doesn\u0026rsquo;t get immediately used. Such liquidity gets \u0026ldquo;injected\u0026rdquo; when current price gets into such \u0026ldquo;sleeping\u0026rdquo; price ranges.\nThese are kinds of price ranges that can exist:\n Active price range, i.e. one that includes current price. Price range placed below current price. The upper tick of this range is below the current tick. Price range placed above current price. The lower tick of this range is above the current tick.  Limit Orders #  An interesting fact about inactive liquidity (i.e. liquidity not provided at current price) is that it acts as limit orders.\nIn trading, limit orders are orders that get executed when price crosses a level chosen by trader. For example, you can place a limit order that buys 1 ETH when its price drops to $1000. Similarly, you can use limit order to sell assets. With Uniswap V3, you can get similar behavior by placing liquidity at ranges that are below or above current price. Let\u0026rsquo;s see how this works:\nIf you provide liquidity below current price (i.e. the price range you chose lays entirely below the current price) or above it, then your whole liquidity will be composed of only one asset–the asset will be the cheaper one of the two. In our example, we\u0026rsquo;re building a pool with ETH being token $x$ and USDC being token $y$, and we define the price as:\n$$P = \\frac{y}{x}$$\nIf we put liquidity below current price, then the liquidity will be composed of USDC solely because, where we added the liquidity, the price of USDC is lower than the current price. Likewise, when we put liquidity above current price, then the liquidity will be composed of ETH because ETH is cheaper in that range.\nRecall this illustration from the introduction:\nIf we buy all available amount of ETH from this range, the range will contain only the other token, USDC, and the price will move to the right of the curve. The price, as we defined it ($\\frac{y}{x}$), will increase. If there\u0026rsquo;s a price range to the right of this one, it needs to have ETH liquidity, and only ETH, not USDC: it needs to provide ETH for next swaps. If we keep buying and rising the price, we might \u0026ldquo;drain\u0026rdquo; the next price range as well, which means buying all its ETH and selling USDC. Again, the price range ends up having only USDC and current price moves outside of it.\nSimilarly, if we\u0026rsquo;re buying USDC token, we move the price to the left and removing USDC tokens from the pool. The next price range will only contain USDC tokens to satisfy our demand, and, similarly to the above scenario, will end up containing only ETH tokens if we buy all USDC from it.\nNote the interesting fact: when crossing an entire price range, it\u0026rsquo;s liquidity is swapped from one token to another. And if we set a very narrow price range, one that gets crossed quickly during a price move, we get a limit order! For example, if you want to buy ETH at a lower price, you need to place a price range containing only USDC at the lower price and wait for current price to cross it. After that, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to remove your liquidity and get it whole converted to ETH!\nI hope this example didn\u0026rsquo;t confuse you! I think this is good way to explain the dynamics of price ranges.\nUpdating mint Function #  To support all the kinds of price ranges, we need to know whether the current price is below, inside, or above the price range specified by user and calculate token amounts accordingly. If the price range is above the current price, we want the liquidity to be composed of token $x$:\n// src/UniswapV3Pool.sol function mint(  ...  if (slot0_.tick \u0026lt; lowerTick) {  amount0 = Math.calcAmount0Delta(  TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(lowerTick),  TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(upperTick),  amount  );  ... When the price range includes the current price, we want both tokens in amounts proportional to the price (this is the scenario we implemented earlier):\n} else if (slot0_.tick \u0026lt; upperTick) {  amount0 = Math.calcAmount0Delta(  slot0_.sqrtPriceX96,  TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(upperTick),  amount  );   amount1 = Math.calcAmount1Delta(  slot0_.sqrtPriceX96,  TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(lowerTick),  amount  );   liquidity = LiquidityMath.addLiquidity(liquidity, int128(amount)); Notice that this is the only scenario where we want to update liquidity since the variable tracks liquidity that\u0026rsquo;s available immediately.\nIn all other cases, when the price range is below the current price, we want the range to contain only token $y$:\n} else {  amount1 = Math.calcAmount1Delta(  TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(lowerTick),  TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(upperTick),  amount  ); } And that\u0026rsquo;s it!\n"},{"id":10,"href":"/docs/milestone_6/erc721-overview/","title":"ERC721 Overview","section":"Milestone 6: NFT positions","content":"ERC721 Overview #  Let\u0026rsquo;s begin with an overview of EIP-721, the standard that defines NFT contracts.\nERC721 is a variant of ERC20. The main difference between them is that ERC721 tokens are non-fungible, that is: one token is not identical to another. To distinguish ERC721 tokens, each of them has a unique ID, which is almost always the counter at which a token was minted. ERC721 tokens also have an extended concept of ownership: owner of each token is tracked and stored in the contract. This means that only distinct tokens, identified by token IDs, can be transferred (or approved for transfer).\nWhat Uniswap V3 liquidity positions and NFTs have in common is this non-fungibility: NFTS and liquidity positions are not interchangeable and are identified by unique IDs. It\u0026rsquo;s this similarity that will allow us to merge the two concepts.\nThe biggest difference between ERC20 and ERC721 is the tokenURI function in the latter. NFT tokens, which are implemented as ERC721 smart contracts, have linked assets that are stored externally, not on blockchain. To link token IDs to images (or sounds, or anything else) stored outside of blockchain, ERC721 defines the tokenURI function. The function is expected to return a link to a JSON file that defines NFT token metadata, e.g.:\n{  \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Thor\u0026#39;s hammer\u0026#34;,  \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Mjölnir, the legendary hammer of the Norse god of thunder.\u0026#34;,  \u0026#34;image\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://game.example/item-id-8u5h2m.png\u0026#34;,  \u0026#34;strength\u0026#34;: 20 } (This example is taken from the ERC721 documentation on OpenZeppelin)\nSuch JSON file defines: the name of a token, the description of a collection, the link to the image of a token, properties of a token.\nAlternatively, we may store JSON metadata and token images on-chain. This is very expensive of course (saving data on-chain is the most expensive operation in Ethereum), but we can make it cheaper if we store templates. All tokens within a collection have similar metadata (mostly identical but image links and properties are different for each token) and visuals. For the latter, we can use SVG, which is an HTML-like format, and HTML is a good templating language.\nWhen storing JSON metadata and SVG on-chain, the tokenURI function, instead of returning a link, would return JSON metadata directly, using the data URI scheme to encode it. SVG images would also be inlined, it won\u0026rsquo;t be necessary making external requests to download token metadata and image.\n"},{"id":11,"href":"/docs/milestone_4/factory-contract/","title":"Factory Contract","section":"Milestone 4. Multi-pool Swaps","content":"Factory Contract #  Uniswap is designed in a way that assumes many discrete Pool contracts, with each pool handling swaps of one token pair. This looks problematic when we want to swap between two tokens that don\u0026rsquo;t have a pool–is there\u0026rsquo;s no pool, no swaps are possible. However, we can still do intermediate swaps: first swap to a token that has pairs with either of the tokens and then swap this token to the target token. This can also go deeper and have more intermediate tokens. However, doing this manually is cumbersome, and, luckily, we make can the process easier by implementing it in our smart contracts.\nFactory contract is a contract that serves multiple purposes:\n It acts as a centralized registry of Pool contracts. Using a factory, you can find all deployed pools, their tokens, and addresses. It simplifies deployment of Pool contracts. EVM allows to deploy smart contracts from smart contracts–Factory uses this feature to make pools deployment a breeze. It makes pool addresses predictable and allows to compute them without making calls to the registry. This makes pools easily discoverable.  Let\u0026rsquo;s build Factory contract! But before doing this, we need to learn something new.\nCREATE and CREATE2 Opcodes #  EVM has two ways of deploying contracts: via CREATE or via CREATE2 opcode. The only difference between them is how new contract address is generated:\n CREATE uses deployer\u0026rsquo;s account nonce to generate a contract address (in pseudocode): KECCAK256(deployer.address, deployer.nonce) nonce is an account-specific counter of transactions. Using nonce in new contract address generation makes it hard to compute an address in other contracts or off-chain apps, mainly because, to find the nonce a contract was deployed at, one needs to scan historical account transactions. CREATE2 uses a custom salt to generate a contract address. This is just an arbitrary sequence of bytes chosen by a developer, which is used to make address generation deterministic (and reduces the chance of a collision). KECCAK256(deployer.address, salt, contractCodeHash)   We need to know the difference because Factory uses CREATE2 when deploying Pool contracts so pools get unique and deterministic addresses that can be computed in other contracts and off-chain apps. Specifically, for salt, Factory computes a hash using these pool parameters:\nkeccak256(abi.encodePacked(token0, token1, tickSpacing)) token0 and token are the addresses of pool tokens, and tickSpacing is something we\u0026rsquo;re going to learn about next.\nTick Spacing #  Recall the loop in swap function:\nwhile (  state.amountSpecifiedRemaining \u0026gt; 0 \u0026amp;\u0026amp;  state.sqrtPriceX96 != sqrtPriceLimitX96 ) {  ...  (step.nextTick, ) = tickBitmap.nextInitializedTickWithinOneWord(...);  (state.sqrtPriceX96, step.amountIn, step.amountOut) = SwapMath.computeSwapStep(...);  ... } This loop finds initialized ticks that have some liquidity by iterating them in either of the directions. This iterating, however, is an expensive operation: if a tick is far away, the code would need to pass all the ticks between the current and the target one, which consumes gas. To make this loop more gas-efficient, Uniswap pools have tickSpacing setting, which sets, as the name suggest, the distance between ticks: the wider the distance, the more gas efficient swaps are.\nHowever, the wider a tick spacing the lower the precision. Low volatility pairs (e.g. stablecoin pairs) need higher precision because price movements are narrow in such pairs. Medium and high volatility pairs need lower precision since price movement are wide in such pairs. To handle this diversity, Uniswap allows to pick a tick spacing when a pair is deployed. Uniswap allows deployers to choose from these options: 10, 60, or 200. And we\u0026rsquo;ll have only 10 and 60 for simplicity.\nIn technical terms, tick indexes can only be multiples of tickSpacing: if tickSpacing is 10, only multiples of 10 will be valid as tick indexes (10, 20, 5000, 5010, but not 8, 12, 5001, etc.). However, and this is important, this doesn\u0026rsquo;t apply to the current price–it can still be any tick because we want it to be as precise as possible. tickSpacing is only applied to price ranges.\nThus, each pool is uniquely identified by this set of parameters:\n token0, token1, tickSpacing;   And, yes, there can be pools with the same tokens but different tick spacings.\n Factory contract uses this set of parameters as a unique identifier of a pool and passes it as a salt to generate a new pool contract address.\n From now on, we\u0026rsquo;ll assume the tick spacing of 60 for all our pools, and we\u0026rsquo;ll use 10 for stablecoin pairs.\n Factory Implementation #  In the constructor of Factory, we need to initialize supported tick spacings:\n// src/UniswapV3Factory.sol contract UniswapV3Factory is IUniswapV3PoolDeployer {  mapping(uint24 =\u0026gt; bool) public tickSpacings;  constructor() {  tickSpacings[10] = true;  tickSpacings[60] = true;  }   ...  We could\u0026rsquo;ve made them constants, but we\u0026rsquo;ll need to have it as a mapping for a later milestone (tick spacings will have different swap fee amounts).\n Factory contract is a contract with only one function createPool. The function begins with necessary checks we need to make before creating a pool:\n// src/UniswapV3Factory.sol contract UniswapV3Factory is IUniswapV3PoolDeployer {  PoolParameters public parameters;  mapping(address =\u0026gt; mapping(address =\u0026gt; mapping(uint24 =\u0026gt; address)))  public pools;   ...   function createPool(  address tokenX,  address tokenY,  uint24 tickSpacing  ) public returns (address pool) {  if (tokenX == tokenY) revert TokensMustBeDifferent();  if (!tickSpacings[tickSpacing]) revert UnsupportedTickSpacing();   (tokenX, tokenY) = tokenX \u0026lt; tokenY  ? (tokenX, tokenY)  : (tokenY, tokenX);   if (tokenX == address(0)) revert TokenXCannotBeZero();  if (pools[tokenX][tokenY][tickSpacing] != address(0))  revert PoolAlreadyExists();   ... Notice that this is first time when we\u0026rsquo;re sorting tokens:\n(tokenX, tokenY) = tokenX \u0026lt; tokenY  ? (tokenX, tokenY)  : (tokenY, tokenX); From now on, we\u0026rsquo;ll also expect pool token addresses to be sorted, i.e. token0 goes before token1 when sorted. We\u0026rsquo;ll enforce this to make salt (and pool addresses) computation consistent.\n This change also affects how we deploy tokens in tests and the deployment script: we need to ensure that WETH is always token0 to make price calculations simpler in Solidity (otherwise, we\u0026rsquo;d need to use fractional prices, like 1/5000). If WETH is not token0 in your tests, change the order of token deployments.\n After that, we prepare pool parameters and deploy a pool:\nparameters = PoolParameters({  factory: address(this),  token0: tokenX,  token1: tokenY,  tickSpacing: tickSpacing });  pool = address(  new UniswapV3Pool{  salt: keccak256(abi.encodePacked(tokenX, tokenY, tickSpacing))  }() );  delete parameters; This piece looks weird because parameters is not used. Uniswap uses Inversion of Control to pass parameters to a pool during deployment. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at updated Pool contract constructor:\n// src/UniswapV3Pool.sol contract UniswapV3Pool is IUniswapV3Pool {  ...  constructor() {  (factory, token0, token1, tickSpacing) = IUniswapV3PoolDeployer(  msg.sender  ).parameters();  }  .. } Aha! Pool expects its deployer to implement IUniswapV3PoolDeployer interface (which only defines the parameters() getter) and calls it in the constructor during deployment to get the parameters. This is what the flow looks like:\n Factory: defines parameters state variable (implements IUniswapV3PoolDeployer) and sets it before deploying a pool. Factory: deploys a pool. Pool: in the constructor, calls parameters() function on its deployer and expects that pool parameters are returned. Factory: calls delete parameters; to clean up the slot of parameters state variable and to reduce gas consumption. This is a temporary state variable that has a value only during a call to createPool().  After a pool is created, we keep it in the pools mapping (so it can be found by its tokens) and emit an event:\n pools[tokenX][tokenY][tickSpacing] = pool;  pools[tokenY][tokenX][tickSpacing] = pool;   emit PoolCreated(tokenX, tokenY, tickSpacing, pool); } Pool Initialization #  As you have noticed from the code above, we no longer set sqrtPriceX96 and tick in Pool\u0026rsquo;s constructor–this is now done in a separate function, initialize, that needs to be called after pool is deployed:\n// src/UniswapV3Pool.sol function initialize(uint160 sqrtPriceX96) public {  if (slot0.sqrtPriceX96 != 0) revert AlreadyInitialized();   int24 tick = TickMath.getTickAtSqrtRatio(sqrtPriceX96);   slot0 = Slot0({sqrtPriceX96: sqrtPriceX96, tick: tick}); } So this is how we deploy pools now:\nUniswapV3Factory factory = new UniswapV3Factory(); UniswapV3Pool pool = UniswapV3Pool(factory.createPool(token0, token1, tickSpacing)); pool.initialize(sqrtP(currentPrice)); PoolAddress Library #  Let\u0026rsquo;s now implement a library that will help us calculate pool contract addresses from other contracts. This library will have only one function, computeAddress:\n// src/lib/PoolAddress.sol library PoolAddress {  function computeAddress(  address factory,  address token0,  address token1,  uint24 tickSpacing  ) internal pure returns (address pool) {  require(token0 \u0026lt; token1);  ... The function needs to know pool parameters (they\u0026rsquo;re used to build a salt) and Factory contract address. It expects the tokens to be sorted, which we discussed above.\nNow, the core of the function:\npool = address(  uint160(  uint256(  keccak256(  abi.encodePacked(  hex\u0026#34;ff\u0026#34;,  factory,  keccak256(  abi.encodePacked(token0, token1, tickSpacing)  ),  keccak256(type(UniswapV3Pool).creationCode)  )  )  )  ) ); This is what CREATE2 does under the hood to calculate new token address. Let\u0026rsquo;s unwind it:\n first, we calculate salt (abi.encodePacked(token0, token1, tickSpacing)) and hash it; then, we obtain Pool contract code (type(UniswapV3Pool).creationCode) and also hash it; then, we build a sequence of bytes that includes: 0xff, Factory contract address, hashed salt, and hashed Pool contract code; we then hash the sequence and convert it to an address.  These steps implement contract address generation as it\u0026rsquo;s defined in EIP-1014, which is the EIP that added CREATE2 opcode. Let\u0026rsquo;s look closer at the values that constitute the hashed byte sequence:\n 0xff, as defined in the EIP, is used to distinguish addresses generated by CREATE and CREATE2; factory is the address of the deployer, in our case a Factory contract; salt was discussed earlier–it uniquely identifies a pool; hashed contract code is needed to protect from collisions: different contracts can have the same salt, but their code hash will be different.  So, according to this scheme, a contract address is a hash of the values that uniquely identify this contract, including its deployer, code, and unique parameters. We can use this function from anywhere to find out a pool address without making any external calls and without querying the factory.\nSimplified Interfaces of Manager and Quoter #  In Manager and Quoter contracts, we no longer need to ask users for pool address! This makes interaction with the contracts easier because users don\u0026rsquo;t need to know pool addresses, they only need to know tokens. However, users also need to specify tick spacing because it\u0026rsquo;s included in pool\u0026rsquo;s salt.\nMoreover, we no longer need to ask users for the zeroForOne flag because we can now always figure it out thanks to tokens sorting. zeroForOne is true when \u0026ldquo;from token\u0026rdquo; is less than \u0026ldquo;to token\u0026rdquo;, since pool\u0026rsquo;s token0 is always less than token1. Likewise, zeroForOne is always false when \u0026ldquo;from token\u0026rdquo; is greater than \u0026ldquo;to token\u0026rdquo;.\n Addresses are hashes, and hashes are numbers, so we can say \u0026ldquo;less than\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;greater that\u0026rdquo; when comparing addresses.\n "},{"id":12,"href":"/docs/milestone_2/output-amount-calculation/","title":"Output Amount Calculation","section":"Milestone 2.

In the previous milestone, we had an analogous formula for the scenario when ETH is bought (buying token $x$):\n$$\\Delta \\sqrt{P} = \\frac{\\Delta y}{L}$$\nThis formula finds the change in the price when selling token $y$. We then added this change to the current price to find the target price:\n$$\\sqrt{P_{target}} = \\sqrt{P_{current}} + \\Delta \\sqrt{P}$$\nNow, we need a similar formula to find the target price when selling token $x$ (ETH in our case) and buying token $y$ (USDC in our case).\nRecall that the change in token $x$ can be calculated as:\n$$\\Delta x = \\Delta \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{P}}L$$\nFrom this formula, we can find the target price:\n$$\\Delta x = (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{P_{target}}} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{P_{current}}}) L$$ $$= \\frac{L}{\\sqrt{P_{target}}} - \\frac{L}{\\sqrt{P_{current}}}$$\nFrom this, we can find $\\sqrt{P_{target}}$ using basic algebraic transformations:\n$$\\sqrt{P_{target}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{P}L}{\\Delta x \\sqrt{P} + L}$$\nKnowing the target price, we can find the output amount similarly to how we found it in the previous milestone.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s update our Python script with the new formula:\n# Swap ETH for USDC amount_in = 0.01337 * eth  print(f\u0026#34;\\nSelling {amount_in/eth}ETH\u0026#34;)  price_next = int((liq * q96 * sqrtp_cur) // (liq * q96 + amount_in * sqrtp_cur))  print(\u0026#34;New price:\u0026#34;, (price_next / q96) ** 2) print(\u0026#34;New sqrtP:\u0026#34;, price_next) print(\u0026#34;New tick:\u0026#34;, price_to_tick((price_next / q96) ** 2))  amount_in = calc_amount0(liq, price_next, sqrtp_cur) amount_out = calc_amount1(liq, price_next, sqrtp_cur)  print(\u0026#34;ETH in:\u0026#34;, amount_in / eth) print(\u0026#34;USDC out:\u0026#34;, amount_out / eth) Its output:\nSelling 0.01337 ETH New price: 4993.777388290041 New sqrtP: 5598789932670289186088059666432 New tick: 85163 ETH in: 0.013369999999998142 USDC out: 66.80838889019013 Which means that we\u0026rsquo;ll get 66.8 USDC when selling 0.01337 ETH using the liquidity we provided in the previous step.\nThis looks good, but enough of Python!

Liquidity providers need to get paid for the liquidity they provide, otherwise they\u0026rsquo;ll just use it somewhere else. To incentivize them, trades pay a small fee during each swap. These fees then distributed among all liquidity providers pro rata (proportionally to their share in total pool liquidity).\nTo better understand the mechanism of fees collection and distribution, let\u0026rsquo;s see how they work.\nHow Swap Fees are Collected #  Swap fees are collected only when a price range is engaged (used in trades). So we need to track the moments when price range boundaries get crossed. This is when a price range gets engaged and this is when we want to start collecting fees for it:\n when price is increasing and a tick is crossed from left to right; when price is decreasing and a tick is crossed from right to left.  This is when a price range gets disengaged:\n when price is increasing and a tick is crossed from right to left; when price is decreasing and a tick is crossed from left to right.  Besides knowing when a price range gets engaged/disengaged, we also want to keep track of how much fees each price range accumulated.\nTo make fees accounting simpler, Uniswap V3 tracks the global fees generated by 1 unit of liquidity. Price range fees are then calculated based on the global ones: fees accumulated outside of a price range are subtracted from the global fees. Fees accumulated outside of a price range are tracked when a tick is crossed (and ticks are crossed when swaps move the price; fees are collected during swaps). With this approach, we don\u0026rsquo;t need to update fees accumulated by each position on very swap–this allows to save a lot of gas and make interaction with pools cheaper.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s recap so we have a clear picture before moving on:\n Fees are paid by users who swap tokens. A small amount is subtracted from input token and accumulated on pool\u0026rsquo;s balance. Each pool has feeGrowthGlobal0X128 and feeGrowthGlobal1X128 state variables that track total accumulated fees per unit of liquidity (that is, fee amount divided by pool\u0026rsquo;s liquidity). Notice that at this point actual positions are not updated to optimize gas usage. Ticks keep record of fees accumulated outside of them. When adding a new position and activating a tick (adding liquidity to a previously empty tick), the tick records how much fees were accumulated outside of it (by convention, we assume all fees were accumulated below the tick). Whenever a tick is activated, fees accumulated outside of the tick are updated as the difference between global fees accumulated outside of the tick and the fees accumulated outside of the tick since the last time it was crossed. Having ticks that know how much fees were accumulated outside of them will allow us to calculated how much fees were accumulated inside of a position (position is a range between two ticks). Knowing how much fees were accumulated inside a position will allow us to calculate the shares of fees liquidity providers are eligible for. If a position wasn\u0026rsquo;t involved in swapping, it\u0026rsquo;ll have zero fees accumulated inside of it and the liquidity providers who provided liquidity into this range will have no profits from it.  Now, let\u0026rsquo;s see how to calculate fees accumulated by a position (step 6).\nCalculating Position Accumulated Fees #  To calculated total fees accumulated by a position, we need to consider two cases: when current price is inside the position and when it\u0026rsquo;s outside of the position. In both cases, we subtract fees collected outside of the lower and the upper ticks of the position from fees collected globally. However, we calculate those fees differently depending on current price.\nWhen current price is inside the position, we subtract the fees that have been collected outside of ticks by this moment:\nWhen current price is outside of the position, we need to update fees collected by either upper or lower ticks before subtracting them from fees collecting globally. We update them only for the calculations and don\u0026rsquo;t overwrite them in ticks because the ticks don\u0026rsquo;t get crossed.\nThis is how we update fees collected outside of a tick:\n$$f_{o}(i) = f_{g} - f_{o}(i)$$\nFees collected outside of a tick ($f_{o}(i)$) is the difference between fees collected globally ($f_{g}$) and fees collected outside of the tick when it crossed last time. We kind of reset the counter when a tick is crossed.\nTo calculate fees collected inside a position:\n$$f_{r} = f_{g} - f_{b}(i_{l}) - f_{a}(i_{u})$$\nWe subtract fees collected below its lower tick ($f_{b}(i_{l})$) and above its upper tick ($f_{a}(i_{u})$) from fees collected globally from all price ranges ($f_{g}$). This is what we saw on the illustration above.\nNow, when current price is above the lower tick (i.e. the position is engaged), we don\u0026rsquo;t need to update fees accumulated below the lower tick and can simply take them from the lower tick. The same is true for fees collected outside of the upper tick when current price is below upper tick. In the two other cases, we need to consider updated fees:\n when taking fees collected below the lower tick and current price is also below the tick (the lower tick hasn\u0026rsquo;t been crossed recently); when taking fees above the upper tick and current price is also above the tick (the upper tick hasn\u0026rsquo;t been crossed recently).  I hope this all is not too confusing. Luckily, we now know everything to start coding!\nAccruing Swap Fees #  To keep it simple, we\u0026rsquo;ll add fees to our codebase step by step. And we\u0026rsquo;ll begin with accruing swap fees.\nAdding Required State Variables #  First thing we need to do is to add the fee amount parameter to Pool–every pool will have a fixed and immutable fee configured during deployment. In the previous chapter, we added Factory contract that unified and simplified pools deployment. One of the required pool parameters was tick spacing. Now, we\u0026rsquo;re going to replace it with fee amount and we\u0026rsquo;ll tie fee amounts to tick spacing: the bigger the fee amount, the larger the tick spacing. This is so that low volatility pools (stablecoin ones) have lower fees.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s update Factory:\n// src/UniswapV3Factory.sol contract UniswapV3Factory is IUniswapV3PoolDeployer {  ...  mapping(uint24 =\u0026gt; uint24) public fees; // `tickSpacings` replaced by `fees`   constructor() {  fees[500] = 10;  fees[3000] = 60;  }   function createPool(  address tokenX,  address tokenY,  uint24 fee  ) public returns (address pool) {  ...  parameters = PoolParameters({  factory: address(this),  token0: tokenX,  token1: tokenY,  tickSpacing: fees[fee],  fee: fee  });  ...  } } Fee amounts are hundredths of the basis point. That is, 1 fee unit is 0.0001%, 500 is 0.05%, and 3000 is 0.3%.\nNext step is to start accumulating fees in Pool. For that, we\u0026rsquo;ll add two global fee accumulator variables:\n// src/UniswapV3Pool.sol contract UniswapV3Pool is IUniswapV3Pool {  ...  uint24 public immutable fee;  uint256 public feeGrowthGlobal0X128;  uint256 public feeGrowthGlobal1X128; } The one with index 0 tracks fees accumulated in token0, the one with index 1 tracks fees accumulated in token1.\nCollecting Fees #  Now we need to update SwapMath.computeSwapStep–this is where we calculate swap amounts and this is also where we\u0026rsquo;ll calculate and subtract swap fees. In the function, we replace all occurrences of amountRemaining with amountRemainingLessFee:\nuint256 amountRemainingLessFee = PRBMath.mulDiv(  amountRemaining,  1e6 - fee,  1e6 ); Thus, we subtract the fee from input token amount and calculate output amount from a smaller input amount.\nThe function now also returns the fee amount collected during the step–it\u0026rsquo;s calculated differently depending on whether the upper limit of the range was reached or not:\nbool max = sqrtPriceNextX96 == sqrtPriceTargetX96; if (!max) {  feeAmount = amountRemaining - amountIn; } else {  feeAmount = Math.mulDivRoundingUp(amountIn, fee, 1e6 - fee); } When it\u0026rsquo;s not reached, the current price range has enough liquidity to fulfill the swap, thus we simply return the difference between the amount we needed to fulfill and the actual amount fulfilled. Notice that amountRemainingLessFee is not involved here since the actual final amount was calculated in amountIn (it\u0026rsquo;s calculated based on available liquidity).\nWhen the target price is reached, we cannot subtract fees from the entire amountRemaining because the current price range doesn\u0026rsquo;t have enough liquidity to fulfill the swap. Thus, fee amount is subtracted from the amount the current price range has fulfilled (amountIn).\nAfter SwapMath.computeSwapStep has returned, we need to update fees accumulated by the swap. Notice that there\u0026rsquo;s only one variable to track them because, when staring a swap, we already know the input token (during a swap, fees are collected in either token0 or token1, not both of them):\nSwapState memory state = SwapState({  ...  feeGrowthGlobalX128: zeroForOne  ? feeGrowthGlobal0X128  : feeGrowthGlobal1X128 });  (...) = SwapMath.computeSwapStep(...);  state.feeGrowthGlobalX128 += PRBMath.mulDiv(  step.feeAmount,  FixedPoint128.Q128,  state.liquidity ); This is where we adjust accrued fees by the amount of liquidity to later distribute fees among liquidity providers in a fair way.\nUpdating Fee Trackers in Ticks #  Next, we need to update the fee trackers in a tick, if it was crossed during a swap (crossing a tick means we\u0026rsquo;re entering a new price range):\nif (state.sqrtPriceX96 == step.sqrtPriceNextX96) {  int128 liquidityDelta = ticks.cross(  step.nextTick,  (  zeroForOne  ? state.feeGrowthGlobalX128  : feeGrowthGlobal0X128  ),  (  zeroForOne  ? feeGrowthGlobal1X128  : state.feeGrowthGlobalX128  )  );  ... } Since we haven\u0026rsquo;t yet updated feeGrowthGlobal0X128/feeGrowthGlobal1X128 state variables at this moment, we pass state.feeGrowthGlobalX128 as either of the fee parameters depending on swap direction. cross function updates the fee trackers as we discussed above:\n// src/lib/Tick.sol function cross(  mapping(int24 =\u0026gt; Tick.Info) storage self,  int24 tick,  uint256 feeGrowthGlobal0X128,  uint256 feeGrowthGlobal1X128 ) internal returns (int128 liquidityDelta) {  Tick.Info storage info = self[tick];  info.feeGrowthOutside0X128 =  feeGrowthGlobal0X128 -  info.feeGrowthOutside0X128;  info.feeGrowthOutside1X128 =  feeGrowthGlobal1X128 -  info.feeGrowthOutside1X128;  liquidityDelta = info.liquidityNet; }  We haven\u0026rsquo;t added the initialization of feeGrowthOutside0X128/feeGrowthOutside1X128 variables–we\u0026rsquo;ll do this in a later step.\n Updating Global Fee Trackers #  And, finally, after the swap is fulfilled, we can update the global fee trackers:\nif (zeroForOne) {  feeGrowthGlobal0X128 = state.feeGrowthGlobalX128; } else {  feeGrowthGlobal1X128 = state.feeGrowthGlobalX128; } Again, during a swap, only one of them is updated because fees are taken from the input token, which is either of token0 or token1 depending on swap direction.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it for swapping! Let\u0026rsquo;s now see what happens to fees when liquidity is added.\nFee Tracking in Positions Management #  When adding or removing liquidity (we haven\u0026rsquo;t implemented the latter yet), we also need to initialize or update fees. Fees need to be tracked both in ticks (fees accumulated outside of ticks–the feeGrowthOutside variables we added just now) and positions (fees accumulated inside of positions). In case of positions, we also need to keep track of and update the amounts of tokens collected as fees–or in other words, we convert fees per liquidity to token amounts. The latter is needed so that when a liquidity provider removes liquidity, they get extra tokens collected as swap fees.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s do it step by step again.\nInitialization of Fee Trackers in Ticks #  In Tick.update function, whenever a tick is initialized (adding liquidity to a previously empty tick), we initialize its fee trackers. However, we\u0026rsquo;re only doing so when the tick is below current price, i.e. when it\u0026rsquo;s inside of the current price range:\n// src/lib/Tick.sol function update(  mapping(int24 =\u0026gt; Tick.Info) storage self,  int24 tick,  int24 currentTick,  int128 liquidityDelta,  uint256 feeGrowthGlobal0X128,  uint256 feeGrowthGlobal1X128,  bool upper ) internal returns (bool flipped) {  ...  if (liquidityBefore == 0) {  // by convention, assume that all previous fees were collected below  // the tick  if (tick \u0026lt;= currentTick) {  tickInfo.feeGrowthOutside0X128 = feeGrowthGlobal0X128;  tickInfo.feeGrowthOutside1X128 = feeGrowthGlobal1X128;  }   tickInfo.initialized = true;  }  ... } If it\u0026rsquo;s not inside of the current price range, its fee trackers will be 0 and they\u0026rsquo;ll be update when the tick is crossed next time (see the cross function we updated above).\nUpdating Position Fees and Token Amounts #  Next step is to calculate the fees and tokens accumulated by a position. Since a position is a range between two ticks, we\u0026rsquo;ll calculate these values using the fee trackers we added to ticks on the previous step. The next function might look messy, but it implements the exact price range fee formulas we saw earlier:\n// src/lib/Tick.sol function getFeeGrowthInside(  mapping(int24 =\u0026gt; Tick.Info) storage self,  int24 lowerTick_,  int24 upperTick_,  int24 currentTick,  uint256 feeGrowthGlobal0X128,  uint256 feeGrowthGlobal1X128 )  internal  view  returns (uint256 feeGrowthInside0X128, uint256 feeGrowthInside1X128) {  Tick.Info storage lowerTick = self[lowerTick_];  Tick.Info storage upperTick = self[upperTick_];   uint256 feeGrowthBelow0X128;  uint256 feeGrowthBelow1X128;  if (currentTick \u0026gt;= lowerTick_) {  feeGrowthBelow0X128 = lowerTick.feeGrowthOutside0X128;  feeGrowthBelow1X128 = lowerTick.feeGrowthOutside1X128;  } else {  feeGrowthBelow0X128 =  feeGrowthGlobal0X128 -  lowerTick.feeGrowthOutside0X128;  feeGrowthBelow1X128 =  feeGrowthGlobal0X128 -  lowerTick.feeGrowthOutside1X128;  }   uint256 feeGrowthAbove0X128;  uint256 feeGrowthAbove1X128;  if (currentTick \u0026lt; upperTick_) {  feeGrowthAbove0X128 = upperTick.feeGrowthOutside0X128;  feeGrowthAbove1X128 = upperTick.feeGrowthOutside1X128;  } else {  feeGrowthAbove0X128 =  feeGrowthGlobal0X128 -  upperTick.feeGrowthOutside0X128;  feeGrowthAbove1X128 =  feeGrowthGlobal0X128 -  upperTick.feeGrowthOutside1X128;  }   feeGrowthInside0X128 =  feeGrowthGlobal0X128 -  feeGrowthBelow0X128 -  feeGrowthAbove0X128;  feeGrowthInside1X128 =  feeGrowthGlobal1X128 -  feeGrowthBelow1X128 -  feeGrowthAbove1X128; } Here, we\u0026rsquo;re calculating fees accumulated between two ticks (inside a price range). For this, we first calculate fees accumulated below the lower tick and then fees calculated above the upper tick. In the end, we subtract those fees from the globally accumulated ones. This is the formula we saw earlier:\n$$f_{r} = f_{g} - f_{b}(i_{l}) - f_{a}(i_{u})$$\nWhen calculating fees collected above and below a tick, we do it differently depending on whether the price range is engaged or not (whether the current price is between the boundary ticks of the price range). When it\u0026rsquo;s engaged we simply use the current fee trackers of a tick; when it\u0026rsquo;s not engaged we need to take updated fee trackers of a tick–you can see these calculations in the two else branches in the code above.\nAfter finding the fees accumulated inside of a position, we\u0026rsquo;re ready to update fee and token amount trackers of the position:\n// src/lib/Position.sol function update(  Info storage self,  int128 liquidityDelta,  uint256 feeGrowthInside0X128,  uint256 feeGrowthInside1X128 ) internal {  uint128 tokensOwed0 = uint128(  PRBMath.mulDiv(  feeGrowthInside0X128 - self.feeGrowthInside0LastX128,  self.liquidity,  FixedPoint128.Q128  )  );  uint128 tokensOwed1 = uint128(  PRBMath.mulDiv(  feeGrowthInside1X128 - self.feeGrowthInside1LastX128,  self.liquidity,  FixedPoint128.Q128  )  );   self.liquidity = LiquidityMath.addLiquidity(  self.liquidity,  liquidityDelta  );  self.feeGrowthInside0LastX128 = feeGrowthInside0X128;  self.feeGrowthInside1LastX128 = feeGrowthInside1X128;   if (tokensOwed0 \u0026gt; 0 || tokensOwed1 \u0026gt; 0) {  self.tokensOwed0 += tokensOwed0;  self.tokensOwed1 += tokensOwed1;  } } When calculating owed tokens, we multiply fees accumulated by the position by liquidity–the reverse of what we did during swapping. In the end, we update the fee trackers and add the token amounts to the previously tracked ones.\nNow, whenever a position is modified (during addition or removal of liquidity), we calculate fees collected by a position and update the position:\n// src/UniswapV3Pool.sol function mint(...) {  ...  bool flippedLower = ticks.update(params.lowerTick, ...);  bool flippedUpper = ticks.update(params.upperTick, ...);  ...  (uint256 feeGrowthInside0X128, uint256 feeGrowthInside1X128) = ticks  .getFeeGrowthInside(  params.lowerTick,  params.upperTick,  slot0_.tick,  feeGrowthGlobal0X128_,  feeGrowthGlobal1X128_  );   position.update(  params.liquidityDelta,  feeGrowthInside0X128,  feeGrowthInside1X128  );  ... } Removing Liquidity #  We\u0026rsquo;re now ready to add the only core feature we haven\u0026rsquo;t implemented yet–removal of liquidity. As opposed to minting, we\u0026rsquo;ll call this function burn. This is the function that will let liquidity providers remove a fraction or whole liquidity from a position they previously added liquidity to. In addition to that, it\u0026rsquo;ll also calculate the fee tokens liquidity providers are eligible for. However, actual transferring of tokens will be done in a separate function–collect.\nBurning Liquidity #  Burning liquidity is opposed to minting. Our current design and implementation makes it a hassle-free task: burning liquidity is simply minting with the negative sign. It\u0026rsquo;s like adding a negative amount of liquidity.\n To implement burn, I needed to refactor the code and extract everything related to position management (updating ticks and position, and token amounts calculation) into _modifyPosition function, which is used by both mint and burn function.\n function burn(  int24 lowerTick,  int24 upperTick,  uint128 amount ) public returns (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) {  (  Position.Info storage position,  int256 amount0Int,  int256 amount1Int  ) = _modifyPosition(  ModifyPositionParams({  owner: msg.sender,  lowerTick: lowerTick,  upperTick: upperTick,  liquidityDelta: -(int128(amount))  })  );   amount0 = uint256(-amount0Int);  amount1 = uint256(-amount1Int);   if (amount0 \u0026gt; 0 || amount1 \u0026gt; 0) {  (position.tokensOwed0, position.tokensOwed1) = (  position.tokensOwed0 + uint128(amount0),  position.tokensOwed1 + uint128(amount1)  );  }   emit Burn(msg.sender, lowerTick, upperTick, amount, amount0, amount1); } In burn function, we first update a position and remove some amount of liquidity from it. Then, we update the token amount owed by the position–they now include amounts accumulated via fees as well as amounts that were previously provided as liquidity. We can also see this as conversion of position liquidity into token amounts owed by the position– these amounts won\u0026rsquo;t be used as liquidity anymore and can be freely redeemed by calling the collect function:\nfunction collect(  address recipient,  int24 lowerTick,  int24 upperTick,  uint128 amount0Requested,  uint128 amount1Requested ) public returns (uint128 amount0, uint128 amount1) {  Position.Info memory position = positions.get(  msg.sender,  lowerTick,  upperTick  );   amount0 = amount0Requested \u0026gt; position.tokensOwed0  ? position.tokensOwed0  : amount0Requested;  amount1 = amount1Requested \u0026gt; position.tokensOwed1  ? position.tokensOwed1  : amount1Requested;   if (amount0 \u0026gt; 0) {  position.tokensOwed0 -= amount0;  IERC20(token0).transfer(recipient, amount0);  }   if (amount1 \u0026gt; 0) {  position.tokensOwed1 -= amount1;  IERC20(token1).transfer(recipient, amount1);  }   emit Collect(  msg.sender,  recipient,  lowerTick,  upperTick,  amount0,  amount1  ); } This function simply transfers tokens from a pool and ensures that only valid amounts can be transferred (one cannot transfer out more than they burned + fees they earned).\nThere\u0026rsquo;s also a way to collect fees only without burning liquidity: burn 0 amount of liquidity and then call collect. During burning, the position will be updated and token amounts it owes will be updated as well.\nAnd, that\u0026rsquo;s it! Our pool implementation is complete now!\n"},{"id":14,"href":"/docs/milestone_3/cross-tick-swaps/","title":"Cross-Tick Swaps","section":"Milestone 3.

Luckily, we have already implemented almost everything we need to make cross-tick swaps. Let\u0026rsquo;s see how cross-tick swaps work before implementing them.\nHow Cross-Tick Swaps Work #  A common Uniswap V3 pool is a pool with many overlapping (and outstanding) price ranges. Each pool tracks current $\\sqrt{P}$ and tick. When users swap tokens they move current price and tick to the left or to the right, depending on swap direction. These movements are caused by tokens being added and removed from pools during swaps.\nPools also track $L$ (liquidity variable in our code), which is the total liquidity provided by all price ranges that include current price. It\u0026rsquo;s expected that, during big price moves, current price moves outside of price ranges. When this happens, such price ranges become inactive and their liquidity gets subtracted from $L$. On the other hand, when current price enters a price range, $L$ is increased and the price range gets activated.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s analyze this illustration:\nThere are three price ranges on this image. The top one is the one currently engaged, it includes the current price. The liquidity of this price range is set to the liquidity state variable of the Pool contract.\nIf we buy all the ETH from the top price range, the price will increase and we\u0026rsquo;ll move to the right price range, which at this moment contains only ETH, not USDC. We might stop in this price range if there\u0026rsquo;s enough liquidity to satisfy our demand. In this case, the liquidity variable will contain only the liquidity provided by this price range. If we continue buying ETH and deplete the right price range, we\u0026rsquo;ll need another price range that\u0026rsquo;s to the right of this price range. If there are no more price ranges, we\u0026rsquo;ll have to stop, and our swap will be satisfied only partially.\nIf we buy all the USDC from the top price range (and sell ETH), the price will decrease and we\u0026rsquo;ll move to the left price range–at this moment it contains only USDC. If we deplete it, we\u0026rsquo;ll need another price range to the left of it.\nThe current price moves during swapping. It moves from one price range to another, but it must always stay within a price range–otherwise, trading is not possible.\nOf course, price ranges can overlap, so, in practice, the transition between price ranges is seamless. And it\u0026rsquo;s not possible to hop over a gap–a swap would be completed partially. It\u0026rsquo;s also worth noting that, in the areas where price ranges overlap, price moves slower. This is due to the fact that supply is higher in such areas and the effect of demand is lower (recall from the introduction that high demand with low supply increases the price).\nOur current implementation doesn\u0026rsquo;t support such fluidity: we only allow swaps within one active price range. This is what we\u0026rsquo;re going to improve now.\nUpdating computeSwapStep Function #  In the swap function, we\u0026rsquo;re iterating over initialized ticks (that is, ticks with liquidity) to fill the amount the user has requested. In each iteration, we:\n find next initialized tick using tickBitmap.nextInitializedTickWithinOneWord; swap in the range between the current price and the next initialized tick (using SwapMath.computeSwapStep); always expect that current liquidity is enough to satisfy the swap (i.e. the price after swap is between the current price and the next initialized tick).  But what happens if the third step is not true? We have this scenario covered in tests:\n// test/UniswapV3Pool.t.sol function testSwapBuyEthNotEnoughLiquidity() public {  ...   uint256 swapAmount = 5300 ether;   ...   vm.expectRevert(stdError.arithmeticError);  pool.swap(address(this), false, swapAmount, extra); } The \u0026ldquo;Arithmetic over/underflow\u0026rdquo; happens when the pool tries to send us more ether than it has. This error happens because, in our current implementation, we always expect that there\u0026rsquo;s enough liquidity to satisfy any swap:\n// src/lib/SwapMath.sol function computeSwapStep(...) {  ...   sqrtPriceNextX96 = Math.getNextSqrtPriceFromInput(  sqrtPriceCurrentX96,  liquidity,  amountRemaining,  zeroForOne  );   amountIn = ...  amountOut = ... } To improve this, we need to consider several situations:\n when the range between the current and the next ticks has enough liquidity to fill amountRemaining; when the range doesn\u0026rsquo;t fill the entire amountRemaining.  In the first case, the swap is done entirely within the range–this is the scenario we have implemented. In the second situation, we\u0026rsquo;ll consume the whole liquidity provided by the range and will move to the next range (if it exists). With this in mind, let\u0026rsquo;s rework computeSwapStep:\n// src/lib/SwapMath.sol function computeSwapStep(...) {  ...  amountIn = zeroForOne  ? Math.calcAmount0Delta(  sqrtPriceCurrentX96,  sqrtPriceTargetX96,  liquidity  )  : Math.calcAmount1Delta(  sqrtPriceCurrentX96,  sqrtPriceTargetX96,  liquidity  );   if (amountRemaining \u0026gt;= amountIn) sqrtPriceNextX96 = sqrtPriceTargetX96;  else  sqrtPriceNextX96 = Math.getNextSqrtPriceFromInput(  sqrtPriceCurrentX96,  liquidity,  amountRemaining,  zeroForOne  );   amountIn = Math.calcAmount0Delta(  sqrtPriceCurrentX96,  sqrtPriceNextX96,  liquidity  );  amountOut = Math.calcAmount1Delta(  sqrtPriceCurrentX96,  sqrtPriceNextX96,  liquidity  ); } First, we calculate amountIn–the input amount the current range can satisfy. If it\u0026rsquo;s smaller than amountRemaining, we say that the current price range cannot fulfil the whole swap, thus the next $\\sqrt{P}$ is the upper/lower $\\sqrt{P}$ of the price range (in other words, we use the entire liquidity of the price range). If amountIn is greater than amountRemaining, we compute sqrtPriceNextX96–it\u0026rsquo;ll be a price within the current price range.\nIn the end, after figuring the next price, we re-compute amountIn and compute amountOut withing this shorter price range (we don\u0026rsquo;t consume the entire liquidity).\nI hope this makes sense!\nUpdating swap Function #  Now, in swap function, we need to handle the case we introduced in the previous part: when swap price reaches a boundary of a price range. When this happens, we want to deactivate the price range we\u0026rsquo;re leaving and active the next price range. We also want to start another iteration of the loop and try to find another tick with liquidity.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what we need to add to the end of the loop:\nif (state.sqrtPriceX96 == step.sqrtPriceNextX96) {  int128 liquidityDelta = ticks.cross(step.nextTick);   if (zeroForOne) liquidityDelta = -liquidityDelta;   state.liquidity = LiquidityMath.addLiquidity(  state.liquidity,  liquidityDelta  );   if (state.liquidity == 0) revert NotEnoughLiquidity();   state.tick = zeroForOne ? step.nextTick - 1 : step.nextTick; } else {  state.tick = TickMath.getTickAtSqrtRatio(state.sqrtPriceX96); } The second branch is what we had before–it handles the case when current price stays within the range. So let\u0026rsquo;s focus on the first one.\nstate.sqrtPriceX96 is the new current price, i.e. the price that will be set after the current swap; step.sqrtPriceNextX96 is the price at the next initialized tick. If these are equal, we have reached a price range boundary. As explained above, when this happens, we want to update $L$ (add or remove liquidity) and continue the swap using the boundary tick as the current tick.\nBy convention, crossing a tick means crossing it from left to right. Thus, crossing lower ticks always adds liquidity and crossing upper ticks always removes it. However, when zeroForOne is true, we negate the sign: when price goes down (token $x$ is being sold), upper ticks add liquidity and lower ticks remove it.\nWhen updating state.tick, if price moves down (zeroForOne is true), we need to subtract 1 to step out of the price range. When moving up (zeroForOne is false), current tick is always excluded in TickBitmap.nextInitializedTickWithinOneWord.\nAnother small, but very important, change that we need to make is to update $L$ when crossing a tick. We do this after the loop:\nif (liquidity_ != state.liquidity) liquidity = state.liquidity; Within the loop, we update state.liquidity multiple times when entering/leaving price ranges. After a swap, we need to update the global $L$ for it to reflect the liquidity available at the new current price.\nLiquidity Tracking and Ticks Crossing #  Let\u0026rsquo;s now look at updated Tick library.\nFirst change is in Tick.Info structure: we now have two variables to track tick liquidity:\nstruct Info {  bool initialized;  // total liquidity at tick  uint128 liquidityGross;  // amount of liqudiity added or subtracted when tick is crossed  int128 liquidityNet; } liquidityGross tracks the absolute liquidity amount of a tick. It\u0026rsquo;s needed to find if tick was flipped or not. liquidityNet, on the other hand, is a signed integer–it tracks the amount of liquidity added (in case of lower tick) or removed (in case of upper tick) when a tick is crossed.\nliquidityNet is set in update function:\nfunction update(  mapping(int24 =\u0026gt; Tick.Info) storage self,  int24 tick,  int128 liquidityDelta,  bool upper ) internal returns (bool flipped) {  ...   tickInfo.liquidityNet = upper  ? int128(int256(tickInfo.liquidityNet) - liquidityDelta)  : int128(int256(tickInfo.liquidityNet) + liquidityDelta); } The cross function we saw above simply returns liquidityNet (it\u0026rsquo;ll get more complicated after we introduce new features in later milestones):\nfunction cross(mapping(int24 =\u0026gt; Tick.Info) storage self, int24 tick)  internal  view  returns (int128 liquidityDelta) {  Tick.Info storage info = self[tick];  liquidityDelta = info.liquidityNet; } Testing #  Let\u0026rsquo;s review different liquidity set ups and test them to ensure our pool implementation can handle them correctly.\nOne Price Range #  This is the scenario we had earlier. After we have updated the code, we need to ensure old functionality keeps working correctly.\n For brevity, I\u0026rsquo;ll show only most important parts of the tests. You can find full tests in the code repo.\n  When buying ETH: function testBuyETHOnePriceRange() public {  LiquidityRange[] memory liquidity = new LiquidityRange[](1);  liquidity[0] = liquidityRange(4545, 5500, 1 ether, 5000 ether, 5000);   ...

Key values after swapping is done:\n sqrtPriceX96 is slightly above or below the initial price and stays within the price rage; currentLiquidity remains unchanged.  Multiple Identical and Overlapping Price Ranges #    When buying ETH:\nfunction testBuyETHTwoEqualPriceRanges() public {  LiquidityRange memory range = liquidityRange(  4545,  5500,  1 ether,  5000 ether,  5000  );  LiquidityRange[] memory liquidity = new LiquidityRange[](2);  liquidity[0] = range;  liquidity[1] = range;   ...

Since those are fully overlapping price ranges, they in fact act as one price range with a higher amount of liquidity. Thus, the price changes slower than in the previous scenario. Also, we get slightly more tokens thanks to deeper liquidity.\nConsecutive Price Ranges #   When buying ETH: function testBuyETHConsecutivePriceRanges() public {  LiquidityRange[] memory liquidity = new LiquidityRange[](2);  liquidity[0] = liquidityRange(4545, 5500, 1 ether, 5000 ether, 5000);  liquidity[1] = liquidityRange(5500, 6250, 1 ether, 5000 ether, 5000);   ...   (int256 expectedAmount0Delta, int256 expectedAmount1Delta) = (  -1.820694594787485635 ether,  10000 ether  );   assertSwapState(  ExpectedStateAfterSwap({  ...  sqrtPriceX96: 6190476002219365604851182401841, // 6105.045728033458  tick: 87173,  currentLiquidity: liquidity[1].amount  })  ); }  When buying USDC: function testBuyUSDCConsecutivePriceRanges() public {  LiquidityRange[] memory liquidity = new LiquidityRange[](2);  liquidity[0] = liquidityRange(4545, 5500, 1 ether, 5000 ether, 5000);  liquidity[1] = liquidityRange(4000, 4545, 1 ether, 5000 ether, 5000);   ...   (int256 expectedAmount0Delta, int256 expectedAmount1Delta) = (  2 ether,  -9103.264925902176327184 ether  );   assertSwapState(  ExpectedStateAfterSwap({  ...  sqrtPriceX96: 5069962753257045266417033265661, // 4094.9666586581643  tick: 83179,  currentLiquidity: liquidity[1].amount  })  ); }   In these scenarios, we make big swaps that cause price to move outside of a price range. As a result, the second price range gets activated and provides enough liquidity to satisfy the swap. In both scenarios, we can see that price lands outside of the current price range and that the price range gets deactivated (current liquidity equals to the liquidity of the second price range).\nPartially Overlapping Price Ranges #    When buying ETH:\nfunction testBuyETHPartiallyOverlappingPriceRanges() public {  LiquidityRange[] memory liquidity = new LiquidityRange[](2);  liquidity[0] = liquidityRange(4545, 5500, 1 ether, 5000 ether, 5000);  liquidity[1] = liquidityRange(5001, 6250, 1 ether, 5000 ether, 5000);   ...

In the areas where the price ranges overlap, there\u0026rsquo;s deeper liquidity, which makes the price movements slower. This is similar to providing more liquidity into the overlapping ranges.\nAlso notice that, in both swaps, we got more tokens than in the \u0026ldquo;Consecutive Price Ranges\u0026rdquo; scenarios–this is again due to deeper liquidity in the overlapping ranges.\n"},{"id":15,"href":"/docs/milestone_5/flash-loan-fees/","title":"Flash Loan Fees","section":"Milestone 5.

Solidity gives us integer and unsigned integer types, which are not enough for for more or less complex math calculations.\nAnother difficulty is gas consumption: the more complex an algorithm, the more gas it consumes. Thus, if we need to have advanced math operations (like exp, ln, sqrt), we want them to be as gas efficient as possible.\nAnd another big problem is the possibility of under/overflow. When multiplying uint256 numbers, there\u0026rsquo;s a risk of an overflow: the result number might be so big that it won\u0026rsquo;t fit into 256 bits.\nAll these difficulties force us to use third-party math libraries that implement advanced math operations and, ideally, optimize their gas consumption. In the case when there\u0026rsquo;s no library for an algorithm we need, we\u0026rsquo;ll have to implement it ourselves, which is a difficult task if we need to implement a unique computation.\nRe-using Math Contracts #  In our Uniswap V3 implementation, we\u0026rsquo;re going to use two third-party math contracts:\n PRBMath, which is a great library of advanced fixed-point math algorithms. We\u0026rsquo;ll use mulDiv function to handle overflows when multiplying and then dividing integer numbers. TickMath from the original Uniswap V3 repo. This contract implements two functions, getSqrtRatioAtTick and getTickAtSqrtRatio, which convert $\\sqrt{P}$\u0026rsquo;s to ticks and back.  Let\u0026rsquo;s focus on the latter.\nIn our contracts, we\u0026rsquo;ll need to convert ticks to corresponding $\\sqrt{P}$ and back.

To have better precision and optimization we\u0026rsquo;ll need unique implementation.\nIf you look at the original code of getSqrtRatioAtTick and getTickAtSqrtRatio you\u0026rsquo;ll see that they\u0026rsquo;re quite complex: there\u0026rsquo;re a lot of magic numbers (like 0xfffcb933bd6fad37aa2d162d1a594001), multiplication, and bitwise operations. At this point, we\u0026rsquo;re not going to analyze the code or re-implement it since this is a very advanced and somewhat different topic. We\u0026rsquo;ll use the contract as is.

Recall that, while working on our implementation, we built the UniswapV3Manager contract to facilitate interaction with pool contracts (to make some calculations simpler and to enable multi-pool swaps). This contract was a good demonstration of how core Uniswap contracts can be extended. And we\u0026rsquo;re going to push this idea a little bit further.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll need a manager contract that will implement the ERC721 standard and will manage liquidity positions. The contract will have the standard NFT functionality (minting, burning, transferring, balances and ownership tracking, etc.) and will allow to provide and remove liquidity to pools. The contract will need to be the actual owner of liquidity in pools because we don\u0026rsquo;t want to let users to add liquidity without minting a token and removing entire liquidity without burning one. We want every liquidity position to be linked to an NFT token, and we want to them to be synchronized.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s see what functions we\u0026rsquo;ll have in the new contract:\n since it\u0026rsquo;ll be an NFT contract, it\u0026rsquo;ll have all the ERC721 functions, including tokenURI, which returns the URI of the image of an NFT token; mint and burn to mint and burn liquidity and NFT tokens at the same time; addLiquidity and removeLiquidity to add and remove liquidity in existing positions; collect, to collect tokens after removing liquidity.  Alright, let\u0026rsquo;s get to code.\nThe Minimal Contract #  Since we don\u0026rsquo;t want to implement the ERC721 standard from scratch, we\u0026rsquo;re going to use a library. We already have Solmate in the dependencies, so we\u0026rsquo;re going to use its ERC721 implementation.\n Using the ERC721 implementation from OpenZeppelin is also an option, but I personally prefer the gas optimized contracts from Solmate.\n This will be the bare minimum of the NFT manager contract:\ncontract UniswapV3NFTManager is ERC721 {  address public immutable factory;   constructor(address factoryAddress)  ERC721(\u0026#34;UniswapV3 NFT Positions\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;UNIV3\u0026#34;)  {  factory = factoryAddress;  }   function tokenURI(uint256 tokenId)  public  view  override  returns (string memory)  {  return \u0026#34;\u0026#34;;  } } tokenURI will return an empty string until we implement a metadata and SVG renderer. We\u0026rsquo;ve added the stub so that the Solidity compiler doesn\u0026rsquo;t fail while we\u0026rsquo;re working on the rest of the contract (the tokenURI function in the Solmate ERC721 contract is virtual, so we must implement it).\nMinting #  Minting, as we discussed earlier, will involve two operations: adding liquidity to a pool and minting an NFT.\nTo keep the links between pool liquidity positions and NFTs, we\u0026rsquo;ll need a mapping and a structure:\nstruct TokenPosition {  address pool;  int24 lowerTick;  int24 upperTick; } mapping(uint256 =\u0026gt; TokenPosition) public positions; To find a position we need:\n a pool address; an owner address; the boundaries of a position (lower and upper ticks).  Since the NFT manager contract will be the owner of all positions created via it, we don\u0026rsquo;t need to store position\u0026rsquo;s owner address and we can only store the rest data. The keys in the positions mapping are token IDs; the mapping links NFT IDs to the position data that\u0026rsquo;s required to find a liquidity position.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s implement minting:\nstruct MintParams {  address recipient;  address tokenA;  address tokenB;  uint24 fee;  int24 lowerTick;  int24 upperTick;  uint256 amount0Desired;  uint256 amount1Desired;  uint256 amount0Min;  uint256 amount1Min; }  function mint(MintParams calldata params) public returns (uint256 tokenId) {  ... } The minting parameters are identical to those of UniswapV3Manager, with an addition of recipient, which will allow to mint NFT to another address.\nIn the mint function, we first add liquidity to a pool:\nIUniswapV3Pool pool = getPool(params.tokenA, params.tokenB, params.fee);  (uint128 liquidity, uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) = _addLiquidity(  AddLiquidityInternalParams({  pool: pool,  lowerTick: params.lowerTick,  upperTick: params.upperTick,  amount0Desired: params.amount0Desired,  amount1Desired: params.amount1Desired,  amount0Min: params.amount0Min,  amount1Min: params.amount1Min  }) ); _addLiquidity is identical to the body of mint function in the UniswapV3Manager contract: it converts ticks to $sqrt(P)$, computes liquidity amount, and calls pool.mint().\nNext, we mint an NFT:\ntokenId = nextTokenId++; _mint(params.recipient, tokenId); totalSupply++; tokenId is set to the current nextTokenId and the latter is then incremented. The _mint function is provided by the ERC721 contract from Solmate. After minting a new token, we update totalSupply.\nFinally, we need to store the information about the new token and the new position:\nTokenPosition memory tokenPosition = TokenPosition({  pool: address(pool),  lowerTick: params.lowerTick,  upperTick: params.upperTick });  positions[tokenId] = tokenPosition; This will later help us find liquidity position by token ID.\nAdding Liquidity #  Next, we\u0026rsquo;ll implement a function to add liquidity to an existing position, in the case when we want more liquidity to a position that already has some. In such cases, we don\u0026rsquo;t want to mint an NFT, but only to increase the amount of liquidity in an existing. position. For that, we\u0026rsquo;ll only need to provide a token ID and token amounts:\nfunction addLiquidity(AddLiquidityParams calldata params)  public  returns (  uint128 liquidity,  uint256 amount0,  uint256 amount1  ) {  TokenPosition memory tokenPosition = positions[params.tokenId];  if (tokenPosition.pool == address(0x00)) revert WrongToken();   (liquidity, amount0, amount1) = _addLiquidity(  AddLiquidityInternalParams({  pool: IUniswapV3Pool(tokenPosition.pool),  lowerTick: tokenPosition.lowerTick,  upperTick: tokenPosition.upperTick,  amount0Desired: params.amount0Desired,  amount1Desired: params.amount1Desired,  amount0Min: params.amount0Min,  amount1Min: params.amount1Min  })  ); } This function ensures there\u0026rsquo;s an existing token and calls pool.mint() with parameters of an existing position.\nRemove Liquidity #  Recall that in the UniswapV3Manager contract we didn\u0026rsquo;t implement a burn function because we wanted users to be owners of liquidity positions. Now, we want the NFT manager to be the owner. And we can have liquidity burning implemented in it:\nstruct RemoveLiquidityParams {  uint256 tokenId;  uint128 liquidity; }  function removeLiquidity(RemoveLiquidityParams memory params)  public  isApprovedOrOwner(params.tokenId)  returns (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) {  TokenPosition memory tokenPosition = positions[params.tokenId];  if (tokenPosition.pool == address(0x00)) revert WrongToken();   IUniswapV3Pool pool = IUniswapV3Pool(tokenPosition.pool);   (uint128 availableLiquidity, , , , ) = pool.positions(  poolPositionKey(tokenPosition)  );  if (params.liquidity \u0026gt; availableLiquidity) revert NotEnoughLiquidity();   (amount0, amount1) = pool.burn(  tokenPosition.lowerTick,  tokenPosition.upperTick,  params.liquidity  ); } We\u0026rsquo;re again checking that provided token ID is valid. And we also need to ensure that a position has enough liquidity to burn.\nCollecting Tokens #  The NFT manager contract can also collect tokens after burning liquidity. Notice that collected tokens are send to msg.sender since the contract manages liquidity on behalf of the caller:\nstruct CollectParams {  uint256 tokenId;  uint128 amount0;  uint128 amount1; }  function collect(CollectParams memory params)  public  isApprovedOrOwner(params.tokenId)  returns (uint128 amount0, uint128 amount1) {  TokenPosition memory tokenPosition = positions[params.tokenId];  if (tokenPosition.pool == address(0x00)) revert WrongToken();   IUniswapV3Pool pool = IUniswapV3Pool(tokenPosition.pool);   (amount0, amount1) = pool.collect(  msg.sender,  tokenPosition.lowerTick,  tokenPosition.upperTick,  params.amount0,  params.amount1  ); } Burning #  Finally, burning. Unlike the other functions of the contract, this function doesn\u0026rsquo;t do anything with a pool: it only burns an NFT. And to burn an NFT, the underlying position must be empty and tokens must be collected. So, if we want to burn an NFT, we need to:\n call removeLiquidity an remove the entire position liquidity; call collect to collect the tokens after burning the position; call burn to burn the token.  function burn(uint256 tokenId) public isApprovedOrOwner(tokenId) {  TokenPosition memory tokenPosition = positions[tokenId];  if (tokenPosition.pool == address(0x00)) revert WrongToken();   IUniswapV3Pool pool = IUniswapV3Pool(tokenPosition.pool);  (uint128 liquidity, , , uint128 tokensOwed0, uint128 tokensOwed1) = pool  .positions(poolPositionKey(tokenPosition));   if (liquidity \u0026gt; 0 || tokensOwed0 \u0026gt; 0 || tokensOwed1 \u0026gt; 0)  revert PositionNotCleared();   delete positions[tokenId];  _burn(tokenId);  totalSupply--; } That\u0026rsquo;s it!\n"},{"id":18,"href":"/docs/milestone_1/providing-liquidity/","title":"Providing Liquidity","section":"Milestone 1.

The --vscode flag tells Forge to configure the Solidity extension for Forge projects.\nNext, remove the default contract and its test:\n script/Contract.s.sol src/Contract.sol test/Contract.t.sol  And that\u0026rsquo;s it! Let\u0026rsquo;s create our first contract!\nPool Contract #  As you\u0026rsquo;ve learned from the introduction, Uniswap deploys multiple Pool contracts, each of which is an exchange market of a pair of tokens. Uniswap groups all its contract into two categories:\n core contracts, and periphery contracts.  Core contracts are, as the name implies, the contracts that implement core logic. These are minimal, user-unfriendly, low-level contracts. Their purpose is to do one thing and do it as reliably and securely as possible. In Uniswap V3, there are 2 such contracts:\n Pool contract, which implements the core logic of a decentralized exchange. Factory contract, which serves as a registry of Pool contracts and a contract that makes deployment of pools easier.  We\u0026rsquo;ll begin with the pool contract, which implements 99% of the core functionality of Uniswap.\nCreate src/UniswapV3Pool.sol:\npragma solidity ^0.8.14;  contract UniswapV3Pool {} Let\u0026rsquo;s think about what data the contract will store:\n Since every pool contract is an exchange market of two tokens, we need to track the two token addresses. And these addresses will be static, set once and forever during pool deployment (thus, they will be immutable). Each pool contract is a set of liquidity positions. We\u0026rsquo;ll store them in a mapping, where keys are unique position identifiers and values are structs holding information about positions. Each pool contract will also need to maintain a ticks registry–this will be a mapping with keys being tick indexes and values being structs storing information about ticks. Since the tick range is limited, we need to store the limits in the contract, as constants. Recall that pool contracts store the amount of liquidity, $L$. So we\u0026rsquo;ll need to have a variable for it. Finally, we need to track the current price and the related tick. We\u0026rsquo;ll store them in one storage slot to optimize gas consumption: these variables will be often read and written together, so it makes sense to benefit from the state variables packing feature of Solidity.  All in all, this is what we begin with:\n// src/lib/Tick.sol library Tick {  struct Info {  bool initialized;  uint128 liquidity;  }  ... }  // src/lib/Position.sol library Position {  struct Info {  uint128 liquidity;  }  ... }  // src/UniswapV3Pool.sol contract UniswapV3Pool {  using Tick for mapping(int24 =\u0026gt; Tick.Info);  using Position for mapping(bytes32 =\u0026gt; Position.Info);  using Position for Position.Info;   int24 internal constant MIN_TICK = -887272;  int24 internal constant MAX_TICK = -MIN_TICK;   // Pool tokens, immutable  address public immutable token0;  address public immutable token1;   // Packing variables that are read together  struct Slot0 {  // Current sqrt(P)  uint160 sqrtPriceX96;  // Current tick  int24 tick;  }  Slot0 public slot0;   // Amount of liquidity, L.  uint128 public liquidity;   // Ticks info  mapping(int24 =\u0026gt; Tick.Info) public ticks;  // Positions info  mapping(bytes32 =\u0026gt; Position.Info) public positions;   ... Uniswap V3 uses many helper contracts and Tick and Position are two of them. using A for B is a feature of Solidity that lets you extend type B with functions from library contract A. This simplifies managing complex data structures.\n For brevity, I\u0026rsquo;ll omit detailed explanation of Solidity syntax and features. Solidity has great documentation, don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate referring to it if something is not clear!\n We\u0026rsquo;ll then initialize some of the variables in the constructor:\n constructor(  address token0_,  address token1_,  uint160 sqrtPriceX96,  int24 tick  ) {  token0 = token0_;  token1 = token1_;   slot0 = Slot0({sqrtPriceX96: sqrtPriceX96, tick: tick});  } } Here, we\u0026rsquo;re setting the token address immutables and setting the current price and tick–we don\u0026rsquo;t need to provide liquidity for the latter.\nThis is our starting point, and our goal in this chapter is to make our first swap using pre-calculated and hard coded values.\nMinting #  The process of providing liquidity in Uniswap V2 is called minting. The reason is that the V2 pool contract mints tokens (LP-tokens) in exchange for liquidity. V3 doesn\u0026rsquo;t do that, but it still uses the same name for the function. Let\u0026rsquo;s use it as well:\nfunction mint(  address owner,  int24 lowerTick,  int24 upperTick,  uint128 amount ) external returns (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) {  ... Our mint function will take:\n Owner\u0026rsquo;s address, to track the owner of the liquidity. Upper and lower ticks, to set the bounds of a price range. The amount of liquidity we want to provide.   Notice that user specifies $L$, not actual token amounts. This is not very convenient of course, but recall that the Pool contract is a core contract–it\u0026rsquo;s not intended to be user-friendly because it should implement only the core logic. In a later chapter, we\u0026rsquo;ll make a helper contract that will convert token amounts to $L$ before calling Pool.mint.\n Let\u0026rsquo;s outline a quick plan of how minting will work:\n a user specifies a price range and an amount of liquidity; the contract updates the ticks and positions mappings; the contract calculates token amounts the user must send (we\u0026rsquo;ll pre-calculate and hard code them); the contract takes tokens from the user and verifies that correct amounts were set.  Let\u0026rsquo;s begin with checking the ticks:\nif (  lowerTick \u0026gt;= upperTick ||  lowerTick \u0026lt; MIN_TICK ||  upperTick \u0026gt; MAX_TICK ) revert InvalidTickRange(); And ensuring that some amount of liquidity is provided:\nif (amount == 0) revert ZeroLiquidity(); Then, add a tick and a position:\nticks.update(lowerTick, amount); ticks.update(upperTick, amount);  Position.Info storage position = positions.get(  owner,  lowerTick,  upperTick ); position.update(amount); The ticks.update function is:\n// src/lib/Tick.sol function update(  mapping(int24 =\u0026gt; Tick.Info) storage self,  int24 tick,  uint128 liquidityDelta ) internal {  Tick.Info storage tickInfo = self[tick];  uint128 liquidityBefore = tickInfo.liquidity;  uint128 liquidityAfter = liquidityBefore + liquidityDelta;   if (liquidityBefore == 0) {  tickInfo.initialized = true;  }   tickInfo.liquidity = liquidityAfter; } It initialized a tick if it had 0 liquidity and adds new liquidity to it. As you can see, we\u0026rsquo;re calling this function on both lower and upper ticks, thus liquidity is added to both of them.\nThe position.update function is:\n// src/libs/Position.sol function update(Info storage self, uint128 liquidityDelta) internal {  uint128 liquidityBefore = self.liquidity;  uint128 liquidityAfter = liquidityBefore + liquidityDelta;   self.liquidity = liquidityAfter; } Similar to the tick update function, it adds liquidity to a specific position. And to get a position we call:\n// src/libs/Position.sol ... function get(  mapping(bytes32 =\u0026gt; Info) storage self,  address owner,  int24 lowerTick,  int24 upperTick ) internal view returns (Position.Info storage position) {  position = self[  keccak256(abi.encodePacked(owner, lowerTick, upperTick))  ]; } ... Each position is uniquely identified by three keys: owner address, lower tick index, and upper tick index. We hash the three to make storing of data cheaper: when hashed, every key will take 32 bytes, instead of 96 bytes when owner, lowerTick, and upperTick are separate keys.\n If we use three keys, we need three mappings. Each key would be stored separately and would take 32 bytes since Solidity stores values in 32-byte slots (when packing is not applied).\n Next, continuing with minting, we need to calculate the amounts that the user must deposit. Luckily, we have already figured out the formulas and calculated the exact amounts in the previous part. So, we\u0026rsquo;re going to hard code them:\namount0 = 0.998976618347425280 ether; amount1 = 5000 ether;  We\u0026rsquo;ll replace these with actual calculations in a later chapter.\n Now, we\u0026rsquo;re ready to take tokens from the user. This is done via a callback:\nfunction mint(...) ... {  ...   uint256 balance0Before;  uint256 balance1Before;  if (amount0 \u0026gt; 0) balance0Before = balance0();  if (amount1 \u0026gt; 0) balance1Before = balance1();  IUniswapV3MintCallback(msg.sender).uniswapV3MintCallback(  amount0,  amount1  );  if (amount0 \u0026gt; 0 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; balance0Before + amount0 \u0026gt; balance0())  revert InsufficientInputAmount();  if (amount1 \u0026gt; 0 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; balance1Before + amount1 \u0026gt; balance1())  revert InsufficientInputAmount();   ... }  function balance0() internal returns (uint256 balance) {  balance = IERC20(token0).balanceOf(address(this)); }  function balance1() internal returns (uint256 balance) {  balance = IERC20(token1).balanceOf(address(this)); } First, we record current token balances. Then we call uniswapV3MintCallback method on the caller–this is the callback. It\u0026rsquo;s expected that the caller (whoever calls mint) is a contract because non-contract addresses cannot implement functions in Ethereum. Using a callback here, while not being user-friendly at all, let\u0026rsquo;s the contract calculate token amounts using its current state–this is critical because we cannot trust users.\nThe caller is expected to implement uniswapV3MintCallback and transfer tokens to the Pool contract in this function. After calling the callback function, we continue with checking whether the Pool contract balances have changed or not: we require them to increase by at least amount0 and amount1 respectively–this would mean the caller has transferred tokens to the pool.\nFinally, we\u0026rsquo;re firing a Mint event:\nemit Mint(msg.sender, owner, lowerTick, upperTick, amount, amount0, amount1); Events is how contract data is indexed in Ethereum for later search. It\u0026rsquo;s a good practice to fire an event whenever contract\u0026rsquo;s state is changed to let blockchain explorer know when this happened. Events also carry useful information. In our case it\u0026rsquo;s: caller\u0026rsquo;s address, liquidity position owner\u0026rsquo;s address, upper and lower ticks, new liquidity, and token amounts. This information will be stored as a log, and anyone else will be able to collect all contract events and reproduce activity of the contract without traversing and analyzing all blocks and transactions.\nAnd we\u0026rsquo;re done! Phew! Now, let\u0026rsquo;s test minting.\nTesting #  At this point we don\u0026rsquo;t know if everything works correctly. Before deploying our contract anywhere we\u0026rsquo;re going to write a bunch of tests to ensure the contract works correctly. Luckily to us, Forge is a great testing framework and it\u0026rsquo;ll make testing a breeze.\nCreate a new test file:\n// test/UniswapV3Pool.t.sol // SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED pragma solidity ^0.8.14;  import \u0026#34;forge-std/Test.sol\u0026#34;;  contract UniswapV3PoolTest is Test {  function setUp() public {}   function testExample() public {  assertTrue(true);  } } Let\u0026rsquo;s run it:\n$ forge test Running 1 test for test/UniswapV3Pool.t.sol:UniswapV3PoolTest [PASS] testExample() (gas: 279) Test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; finished in 5.07ms It passes! Of course it is! So far, our test only checks that true is true!\nTest contract are just contract that inherit from forge-std/Test.sol. This contract is a set of testing utilities, we\u0026rsquo;ll get acquainted with them step by step. If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to wait, open lib/forge-std/src/Test.sol and skim through it.\nTest contracts follow a specific convention:\n setUp function is used to set up test cases. In each test cases, we want to have a configured environment, like deployed contracts, minted tokens, initialized pools–we\u0026rsquo;ll do all this in setUp. Every test case starts with test prefix, e.g. testMint(). This will let Forge distinguish test cases from helper functions (we can also have any function we want).  Let\u0026rsquo;s now actually test minting.\nTest Tokens #  To test minting we need tokens. This is not a problem because we can deploy any contract in tests! Moreover, Forge can install open-source contracts as dependencies. Specifically, we need an ERC20 contract with minting functionality. We\u0026rsquo;ll use the ERC20 contract from Solmate, a collection of gas-optimized contracts, and make an ERC20 contract that inherits from the Solmate contract and exposes minting (it\u0026rsquo;s public by default).\nLet\u0026rsquo;s install solmate:\n$ forge install rari-capital/solmate Then, let\u0026rsquo;s create ERC20Mintable.sol contract in test folder (we\u0026rsquo;ll use the contract only in tests):\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED pragma solidity ^0.8.14;  import \u0026#34;solmate/tokens/ERC20.sol\u0026#34;;  contract ERC20Mintable is ERC20 {  constructor(  string memory _name,  string memory _symbol,  uint8 _decimals  ) ERC20(_name, _symbol, _decimals) {}   function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public {  _mint(to, amount);  } } Our ERC20Mintable inherits all functionality from solmate/tokens/ERC20.sol and we additionally implement public mint method which will allow us to mint any number of tokens.\nMinting #  Now, we\u0026rsquo;re ready to test minting.\nFirst, let\u0026rsquo;s deploy all the required contracts:\n// test/UniswapV3Pool.t.sol ... import \u0026#34;./ERC20Mintable.sol\u0026#34;; import \u0026#34;../src/UniswapV3Pool.sol\u0026#34;;  contract UniswapV3PoolTest is Test {  ERC20Mintable token0;  ERC20Mintable token1;  UniswapV3Pool pool;   function setUp() public {  token0 = new ERC20Mintable(\u0026#34;Ether\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ETH\u0026#34;, 18);  token1 = new ERC20Mintable(\u0026#34;USDC\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;USDC\u0026#34;, 18);  }   ... In the setUp function, we deploy tokens but not pools! This is because all our test cases will use the same tokens but each of them will have a unique pool.\nTo make setting up of pools cleaner and simpler, we\u0026rsquo;ll do this in a separate function, setupTestCase, that takes a set of test case parameters. In our first test case, we\u0026rsquo;ll test successful liquidity minting. This is what the test case parameters look like:\nfunction testMintSuccess() public {  TestCaseParams memory params = TestCaseParams({  wethBalance: 1 ether,  usdcBalance: 5000 ether,  currentTick: 85176,  lowerTick: 84222,  upperTick: 86129,  liquidity: 1517882343751509868544,  currentSqrtP: 5602277097478614198912276234240,  shouldTransferInCallback: true,  mintLiqudity: true  });  We\u0026rsquo;re planning to deposit 1 ETH and 5000 USDC into the pool. We want the current tick to be 85176, and lower and upper ticks being 84222 and 86129 respectively (we calculated these values in the previous chapter). We\u0026rsquo;re specifying the precalculated liquidity and current $\\sqrt{P}$. We also want to deposit liquidity (mintLiquidity parameter) and transfer tokens when requested by the pool contract (shouldTransferInCallback). We don\u0026rsquo;t want to do this in each test case, so we want have the flags.  Next, we\u0026rsquo;re calling setupTestCase with the above parameters:\nfunction setupTestCase(TestCaseParams memory params)  internal  returns (uint256 poolBalance0, uint256 poolBalance1) {  token0.mint(address(this), params.wethBalance);  token1.mint(address(this), params.usdcBalance);   pool = new UniswapV3Pool(  address(token0),  address(token1),  params.currentSqrtP,  params.currentTick  );   if (params.mintLiqudity) {  (poolBalance0, poolBalance1) = pool.mint(  address(this),  params.lowerTick,  params.upperTick,  params.liquidity  );  }   shouldTransferInCallback = params.shouldTransferInCallback; } In this function, we\u0026rsquo;re minting tokens and deploying a pool. Also, when the mintLiquidity flag is set, we mint liquidity in the pool. At the end, we\u0026rsquo;re setting the shouldTransferInCallback flag for it to be read in the mint callback:\nfunction uniswapV3MintCallback(uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) public {  if (shouldTransferInCallback) {  token0.transfer(msg.sender, amount0);  token1.transfer(msg.sender, amount1);  } } It\u0026rsquo;s the test contract that will provide liquidity and will call the mint function on the pool, there\u0026rsquo;re no users. The test contract will act as a user, thus it can implement the mint callback function.\nSetting up test cases like that is not mandatory, you can do it however feels most comfortable to you. Test contracts are just contracts.\nIn testMintSuccess, we want to test that the pool contract:\n takes the correct amounts of tokens from us; creates a position with correct key and liquidity; initializes the upper and lower ticks we\u0026rsquo;ve specified; has correct $\\sqrt{P}$ and $L$.  Let\u0026rsquo;s do this.\nMinting happens in setupTestCase, so we don\u0026rsquo;t need to do this again. The function also returns the amounts we have provided, so let\u0026rsquo;s check them:\n(uint256 poolBalance0, uint256 poolBalance1) = setupTestCase(params);  uint256 expectedAmount0 = 0.998976618347425280 ether; uint256 expectedAmount1 = 5000 ether; assertEq(  poolBalance0,  expectedAmount0,  \u0026#34;incorrect token0 deposited amount\u0026#34; ); assertEq(  poolBalance1,  expectedAmount1,  \u0026#34;incorrect token1 deposited amount\u0026#34; ); We expect specific pre-calculated amounts. And we can also check that these amounts were actually transferred to the pool:\nassertEq(token0.balanceOf(address(pool)), expectedAmount0); assertEq(token1.balanceOf(address(pool)), expectedAmount1); Next, we need to check the position the pool created for us. Remember that the key in positions mapping is a hash? We need to calculate it manually and then get our position from the contract:\nbytes32 positionKey = keccak256(  abi.encodePacked(address(this), params.lowerTick, params.upperTick) ); uint128 posLiquidity = pool.positions(positionKey); assertEq(posLiquidity, params.liquidity);  Since Position.Info is a struct, it gets destructured when fetched: each field gets assigned to a separate variable.\n Next come the ticks. Again, it\u0026rsquo;s straightforward:\n(bool tickInitialized, uint128 tickLiquidity) = pool.ticks(  params.lowerTick ); assertTrue(tickInitialized); assertEq(tickLiquidity, params.liquidity);  (tickInitialized, tickLiquidity) = pool.ticks(params.upperTick); assertTrue(tickInitialized); assertEq(tickLiquidity, params.liquidity); And finally, $\\sqrt{P}$ and $L$:\n(uint160 sqrtPriceX96, int24 tick) = pool.slot0(); assertEq(  sqrtPriceX96,  5602277097478614198912276234240,  \u0026#34;invalid current sqrtP\u0026#34; ); assertEq(tick, 85176, \u0026#34;invalid current tick\u0026#34;); assertEq(  pool.liquidity(),  1517882343751509868544,  \u0026#34;invalid current liquidity\u0026#34; ); As you can see, writing tests in Solidity is not hard!\nFailures #  Of course, testing only successful scenarios is not enough. We also need to test failing cases. What can go wrong when providing liquidity? Here are a couple of hints:\n Upper and lower ticks are too big or too small. Zero liquidity is provided. Liquidity provider doesn\u0026rsquo;t have enough of tokens.  I\u0026rsquo;ll leave it for you to implement these scenarios! Feel free peeking at the code in the repo.\n"},{"id":19,"href":"/docs/milestone_4/path/","title":"Swap Path","section":"Milestone 4. Multi-pool Swaps","content":"Swap Path #  Let\u0026rsquo;s imagine that we have only these pools: WETH/USDC, USDC/USDT, WBTC/USDT. If we want to swap WETH for WBTC, we\u0026rsquo;ll need to make multiple swaps (WETH→USDC→USDT→WBTC) since there\u0026rsquo;s no WETH/WBTC pool. We can do this manually or we can improve our contracts to handle such chained, or multi-pool, swaps. Of course, we\u0026rsquo;ll do the latter!\nWhen doing multi-pool swaps, we\u0026rsquo;re sending output of a previous swap to the input of the next one. For example:\n in WETH/USDC pool, we\u0026rsquo;re selling WETH and buying USDC; in USDC/USDT pool, we\u0026rsquo;re selling USDC from the previous swap and buying USDT; in WBTC/USDT pool, we\u0026rsquo;re selling USDT from the previous pool and buying WBTC.  We can turn this series into a path:\nWETH/USDC,USDC/USDT,WBTC/USDT And iterate over such path in our contracts to perform multiple swaps in one transaction. However, recall from the previous chapter that we don\u0026rsquo;t need to know pool addresses and, instead, we can derive them from pool parameters. Thus, the above swap can be turned into a series of tokens:\nWETH, USDC, USDT, WBTC And recall that tick spacing is another parameter (besides tokens) that identifies a pool. Thus, the above path becomes:\nWETH, 60, USDC, 10, USDT, 60, WBTC Where 60 and 10 are tick spacings. We\u0026rsquo;re using 60 in volatile pairs (e.g. ETH/USDC, WBTC/USDT) and 10 in stablecoin pairs (USDC/USDT).\nNow, having such path, we can iterate over it to build pool parameters for each of the pool:\n WETH, 60, USDC; USDC, 10, USDT; USDT, 60, WBTC.  Knowing these parameters, we can derive pool addresses using PoolAddress.computeAddress, which we implemented in the previous chapter.\n We also can use this concept when doing swaps within one pool: the path would simple contain the parameters of one pool. And, thus, we can use swap paths in all swaps, universally.\n Let\u0026rsquo;s build a library to work with swap paths.\nPath Library #  In code, a swap path is a sequence of bytes. In Solidity, a path can be built like that:\nbytes.concat(  bytes20(address(weth)),  bytes3(uint24(60)),  bytes20(address(usdc)),  bytes3(uint24(10)),  bytes20(address(usdt)),  bytes3(uint24(60)),  bytes20(address(wbtc)) ); And it looks like that:\n0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2 # weth address  00003c # 60  A0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48 # usdc address  00000a # 10  dAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7 # usdt address  00003c # 60  2260FAC5E5542a773Aa44fBCfeDf7C193bc2C599 # wbtc address These are the functions that we\u0026rsquo;ll need to implement:\n calculating the number of pools in a path; figuring out if a path has multiple tokens; extracting first pool parameters from a path; proceeding to the next pair in a path; and decoding first pool parameters.  Calculating the Number of Pools in a Path #  Let\u0026rsquo;s begin with calculating the number of pools in a path:\n// src/lib/Path.sol library Path {  /// @dev The length the bytes encoded address  uint256 private constant ADDR_SIZE = 20;  /// @dev The length the bytes encoded tick spacing  uint256 private constant TICKSPACING_SIZE = 3;   /// @dev The offset of a single token address + tick spacing  uint256 private constant NEXT_OFFSET = ADDR_SIZE + TICKSPACING_SIZE;  /// @dev The offset of an encoded pool key (tokenIn + tick spacing + tokenOut)  uint256 private constant POP_OFFSET = NEXT_OFFSET + ADDR_SIZE;  /// @dev The minimum length of a path that contains 2 or more pools;  uint256 private constant MULTIPLE_POOLS_MIN_LENGTH =  POP_OFFSET + NEXT_OFFSET;   ... We first define a few constants:\n ADDR_SIZE is the size of an address, 20 bytes; TICKSPACING_SIZE is the size of a tick spacing, 3 bytes (uint24); NEXT_OFFSET is the offset of a next token address–to get it, we skip an address and a tick spacing; POP_OFFSET is the offset of a pool key (token address + tick spacing + token address); MULTIPLE_POOLS_MIN_LENGTH is the length of a path that contains 2 or more pools (one set of pool parameters + tick spacing + token address).  To count the number of pools in a path, we subtract the size of an address (first or last token in a path) and divide the remaining part by NEXT_OFFSET (address + tick spacing):\nfunction numPools(bytes memory path) internal pure returns (uint256) {  return (path.length - ADDR_SIZE) / NEXT_OFFSET; } Figuring Out If a Path Has Multiple Tokens #  To check if there are multiple pools in a path, we need to compare the length of a path with MULTIPLE_POOLS_MIN_LENGTH:\nfunction hasMultiplePools(bytes memory path) internal pure returns (bool) {  return path.length \u0026gt;= MULTIPLE_POOLS_MIN_LENGTH; } Extracting First Pool Parameters From a Path #  To implement the other functions, we\u0026rsquo;ll need a helper library because Solidity doesn\u0026rsquo;t have native bytes manipulation functions. Specifically, we\u0026rsquo;ll need a function to extract a sub-array from an array of bytes, and a couple of functions to convert bytes to address and uint24.\nLuckily, there\u0026rsquo;s a great open-source library called solidity-bytes-utils. To use the library, we need to extend the bytes type in the Path library:\nlibrary Path {  using BytesLib for bytes;  ... } We can implement getFirstPool now:\nfunction getFirstPool(bytes memory path)  internal  pure  returns (bytes memory) {  return path.slice(0, POP_OFFSET); } The function simply returns the first \u0026ldquo;token address + tick spacing + token address\u0026rdquo; segment encoded as bytes.\nProceeding to a Next Pair in a Path #  We\u0026rsquo;ll use the next function when iterating over a path and throwing away processed pools. Notice that we\u0026rsquo;re removing \u0026ldquo;token address + tick spacing\u0026rdquo;, not full pool parameters, because we need the other token address to calculate next pool address.\nfunction skipToken(bytes memory path) internal pure returns (bytes memory) {  return path.slice(NEXT_OFFSET, path.length - NEXT_OFFSET); } Decoding First Pool Parameters #  And, finally, we need to decode the parameters of the first pool in a path:\nfunction decodeFirstPool(bytes memory path)  internal  pure  returns (  address tokenIn,  address tokenOut,  uint24 tickSpacing  ) {  tokenIn = path.toAddress(0);  tickSpacing = path.toUint24(ADDR_SIZE);  tokenOut = path.toAddress(NEXT_OFFSET); } Unfortunately, BytesLib doesn\u0026rsquo;t implement toUint24 function but we can implement it ourselves! BytesLib has multiple toUintXX functions, so we can take one of them and convert to a uint24 one:\nlibrary BytesLibExt {  function toUint24(bytes memory _bytes, uint256 _start)  internal  pure  returns (uint24)  {  require(_bytes.length \u0026gt;= _start + 3, \u0026#34;toUint24_outOfBounds\u0026#34;);  uint24 tempUint;   assembly {  tempUint := mload(add(add(_bytes, 0x3), _start))  }   return tempUint;  } } We\u0026rsquo;re doing this in a new library contract, which we can then use in our Path library alongside BytesLib:\nlibrary Path {  using BytesLib for bytes;  using BytesLibExt for bytes;  ... } "},{"id":20,"href":"/docs/introduction/uniswap-v3/","title":"Uniswap V3","section":"Milestone 0.

Again, it\u0026rsquo;s totally ok if you don\u0026rsquo;t understand all the concepts. They will be clearer when converted to code.\n To better understand the innovations Uniswap V3 brings, let\u0026rsquo;s first look at the imperfections of Uniswap V2.\nUniswap V2 is a general exchange that implements one AMM algorithm. However, not all trading pairs are equal. Pairs can be grouped by price volatility:\n Tokens with medium and high price volatility. This group includes most tokens since most tokens don\u0026rsquo;t have their prices pegged to something and are subject to market fluctuations. Tokens with low volatility. This group includes pegged tokens, mainly stablecoins: USDC/USDT, USDC/DAI, USDT/DAI, etc. Also: ETH/stETH, ETH/rETH (variants of wrapped ETH).  These groups require different, let\u0026rsquo;s call them, pool configurations. The main difference is that pegged tokens require high liquidity to reduce the demand effect (we learned about it in the previous chapter) on big trades. The prices of USDC and USDT must stay close to 1, no matter how big the number of tokens we want to buy and sell. Since Uniswap V2\u0026rsquo;s general AMM algorithm is not very well suited for stablecoin trading, alternative AMMs (mainly Curve) were more popular for stablecoin trading.\nWhat caused this problem is that liquidity in Uniswap V2 pools is distributed infinitely–pool liquidity allows trades at any price, from 0 to infinity:\nThis might not seem like a bad thing, but this makes capital inefficient. Historical prices of an asset stay within some defined range, whether it\u0026rsquo;s narrow or wide. For example, the historical price range of ETH is from $0.75 to $4,800 (according to CoinMarketCap). Today (June 2022, 1 ETH costs $1,800), no one would buy 1 ether at $5000, so it makes no sense to provide liquidity at this price. Thus, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t really make sense providing liquidity in a price range that\u0026rsquo;s far away from the current price or that will never be reached.\n However, we all believe in ETH reaching $10,000 one day.\n Concentrated Liquidity #  Uniswap V3 introduces concentrated liquidity: liquidity providers can now choose the price range they want to provide liquidity into. This improves capital efficiency by allowing to put more liquidity into a narrow price range, which makes Uniswap more diverse: it can now have pools configured for pairs with different volatility. This is how V3 improves V2.\nIn a nutshell, a Uniswap V3 pair is many small Uniswap V2 pairs. The main difference between V2 and V3 is that, in V3, there are many price ranges in one pair. And each of these shorter price ranges has finite reserves. The entire price range from 0 to infinite is split into shorter price ranges, with each of them having its own amount of liquidity. But, what\u0026rsquo;s crucial is that within that shorter price ranges, it works exactly as Uniswap V2. This is why I say that a V3 pair is many small V2 pairs.\nNow, let\u0026rsquo;s try to visualize it. What we\u0026rsquo;re saying is that we don\u0026rsquo;t want the curve to be finite. We cut it at the points $a$ and $b$ and say that these are the boundaries of the curve. Moreover, we shift the curve so the boundaries lay on the axes. This is what we get:\n It looks lonely, doesn\u0026rsquo;t it? This is why there are many price ranges in Uniswap V3–so they don\u0026rsquo;t feel lonely 🙂\n As we saw in the previous chapter, buying or selling tokens moves the price along the curve. A price range limits the movement of the price. When the price moves to either of the points, the pool becomes depleted: one of the token reserves will be 0 and buying this token won\u0026rsquo;t be possible.\nOn the chart above, let\u0026rsquo;s assume that the start price is at the middle of the curve. To get to the point $a$, we need to buy all available $y$ and maximize $x$ in the range; to get to the point $b$, we need to buy all available $x$ and maximize $y$ in the range. At these points, there\u0026rsquo;s only one token in the range!\n Fun fact: this allows to use Uniswap V3 price ranges as limit-orders!\n What happens when the current price range gets depleted during a trade? The price slips into the next price range. If the next price range doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, the trade ends up fulfilled partially-we\u0026rsquo;ll see how this works later in the book.\nThis is how liquidity is spread in the USDC/ETH pool in production:\nYou can see that there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of liquidity around the current price but the further away from it the less liquidity there is–this is because liquidity providers strive to have higher efficiency of their capital. Also, the whole range is not infinite, it\u0026rsquo;s upper boundary is shown on the image.\nThe Mathematics of Uniswap V3 #  Mathematically, Uniswap V3 is based on V2: it uses the same formulas, but they\u0026rsquo;re\u0026hellip; let\u0026rsquo;s call it augmented.\nTo handle transitioning between price ranges, simplify liquidity management, and avoid rounding errors, Uniswap V3 uses these new concepts:\n$$L = \\sqrt{xy}$$\n$$\\sqrt{P} = \\sqrt{\\frac{y}{x}}$$\n$L$ is the amount of liquidity. Liquidity in a pool is the combination of token reserves (that is, two numbers). We know that their product is $k$, and we can use this to derive the measure of liquidity, which is $\\sqrt{xy}$–a number that, when multiplied by itself, equals to $k$. $L$ is the geometric mean of $x$ and $y$.\n$y/x$ is the price of token 0 in terms of 1. Since token prices in a pool are reciprocals of each other, we can use only one of them in calculations (and by convention Uniswap V3 uses $y/x$). The price of token 1 in terms of token 0 is simply $\\frac{1}{y/x}=\\frac{x}{y}$. Similarly, $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{P}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{y/x}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{x}{y}}$.\nWhy using $\\sqrt{p}$ instead of $p$? There are two reasons:\n  Square root calculation is not precise and causes rounding errors. Thus, it\u0026rsquo;s easier to store the square root without calculating it in the contracts (we will not store $x$ and $y$ in the contracts).\n  $\\sqrt{P}$ has an interesting connection to $L$: $L$ is also the relation between the change in output amount and the change in $\\sqrt{P}$.\n$$L = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta\\sqrt{P}}$$\n   Proof: $$L = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta\\sqrt{P}}$$ $$\\sqrt{xy} = \\frac{y_1 - y_0}{\\sqrt{P_1} - \\sqrt{P_0}}$$ $$\\sqrt{xy} (\\sqrt{P_1} - \\sqrt{P_0}) = y_1 - y_0$$ $$\\sqrt{xy} (\\sqrt{\\frac{y_1}{x_1}} - \\sqrt{\\frac{y_0}{x_0}}) = y_1 - y_0$$ $$\\sqrt{y_1^2} - \\sqrt{y_0^2} = y_1 - y_0$$ $$y_1 - y_0 = y_1 - y_0$$\n Pricing #  Again, we don\u0026rsquo;t need to calculate actual prices–we can calculate output amount right away. Also, since we\u0026rsquo;re not going to track and store $x$ and $y$, our calculation will be based only on $L$ and $\\sqrt{P}$.\nFrom the above formula, we can find $\\Delta y$:\n$$\\Delta y = \\Delta \\sqrt{P} L$$\n See the third step in the proof above.\n As we discussed above, prices in a pool are reciprocals of each other. Thus, $\\Delta x$ is:\n$$\\Delta x = \\Delta \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{P}} L$$\n$L$ and $\\sqrt{P}$ allow us to not store and update pool reserves. Also, we don\u0026rsquo;t need to calculate $\\sqrt{P}$ each time because we can always find $\\Delta \\sqrt{P}$ and its reciprocal.\nTicks #  As we learned in this chapter, the infinite price range of V2 is split into shorter price ranges in V3. Each of these shorter price ranges is limited by boundaries–upper and lower points. To track the coordinates of these boundaries, Uniswap V3 uses ticks.\nIn V3, the entire price range is demarcated by evenly distributed discrete ticks. Each tick has an index and corresponds to a certain price:\n$$p(i) = 1.0001^i$$\nWhere $p(i)$ is the price at tick $i$. Taking powers of 1.0001 has a desirable property: the difference between two adjacent ticks is 0.01% or 1 basis point.\n Basis point (1/100th of 1%, or 0.01%, or 0.0001) is a unit of measure of percentages in finance. You could\u0026rsquo;ve heard about basis point when central banks announced changes in interest rates.\n As we discussed above, Uniswap V3 stores $\\sqrt{P}$, not $P$. Thus, the formula is in fact:\n$$\\sqrt{p(i)} = \\sqrt{1.0001}^i = 1.0001 ^{\\frac{i}{2}}$$\nSo, we get values like: $\\sqrt{p(0)} = 1$, $\\sqrt{p(1)} = \\sqrt{1.0001} \\approx 1.00005$, $\\sqrt{p(-1)} \\approx 0.99995$.\nTicks are integers that can be positive and negative and, of course, they\u0026rsquo;re not infinite. Uniswap V3 stores $\\sqrt{P}$ as a fixed point Q64.96 number, which is a rational number that uses 64 bits for the integer part and 96 bits for the fractional part. Thus, prices are within the range: $[2^{-128}, 2^{128}]$. And ticks are within the range:\n$$[log_{1.0001}2^{-128}, log_{1.0001}{2^{128}}] = [-887272, 887272]$$\n For deeper dive into the math of Uniswap V3, I cannot but recommend this technical note by Atis Elsts.\n "},{"id":21,"href":"/docs/introduction/dev-environment/","title":"Development Environment","section":"Milestone 0. Introduction","content":"Development environment #  We\u0026rsquo;re going to build two applications:\n An on-chain one: a set of smart contracts deployed on Ethereum. An off-chain one: a front-end application that will interact with the smart contracts.  While the front-end application development is part of this book, it won\u0026rsquo;t be our main focus. We will build it solely to demonstrate how smart contracts are integrated with front-end applications. Thus, the front-end application is optional, but I\u0026rsquo;ll still provide the code.\nQuick Introduction to Ethereum #  Ethereum is a blockchain that allows anyone to run applications on it. It might look like a cloud provider, but there are multiple differences:\n You don\u0026rsquo;t pay for hosting your application. But you pay for deployment. Your application is immutable. That is: you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to modify it after it\u0026rsquo;s deployed. Users will pay to use your application.  To better understand these moments, let\u0026rsquo;s see what Ethereum is made of.\nAt the core of Ethereum (and any other blockchain) is a database. The most valuable data in Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s database is the state of accounts. An account is an Ethereum address with associated data:\n Balance: account\u0026rsquo;s ether balance. Code: bytecode of the smart contract deployed at this address. Storage: space used by smart contracts to store data. Nonce: a serial integer that\u0026rsquo;s used to protect against replay attacks.  Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s main job is building and maintaining this data in a secure way that doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow unauthorized access.\nEthereum is also a network, a network of computers that build and maintain the state independently of each other. The main goal of the network is to decentralize access to the database: there must be no single authority that\u0026rsquo;s allowed to modify anything in the database unilaterally. This is achieved by a means of consensus, which is a set of rules all the nodes in the network follow. If one party decides to abuse a rule, it\u0026rsquo;ll be excluded from the network.\n Fun fact: blockchain can use MySQL! Nothing prevents this besides performance. In its turn, Ethereum uses LevelDB, a fast key-value database.\n Every Ethereum node also runs EVM, Ethereum Virtual Machine. A virtual machine is a program that can run other programs, and EVM is a program that executes smart contracts. Users interact with contracts through transactions: besides simply sending ether, transactions can contain smart contract call data. It includes:\n An encoded contract function name. Function parameters.  Transactions are packed in blocks and blocks then mined by miners. Each participant of the network can validate any transaction and any block.\nIn a sense, smart contracts are similar to JSON APIs but instead of endpoints you call smart contract functions and you provide function arguments. Similar to API backends, smart contracts execute programmed logic, which can optionally modify smart contract storage. Unlike JSON API, you need to send a transaction to mutate blockchain state, and you\u0026rsquo;ll need to pay for each transaction you\u0026rsquo;re sending.\nFinally, Ethereum nodes expose a JSON-RPC API. Through this API we can interact with a node to: get account balance, estimate gas costs, get blocks and transactions, send transactions, and execute contract calls without sending transactions (this is used to read data from smart contracts). Here you can find the full list of available endpoints.\n Transactions are also sent through the JSON-RPC API, see eth_sendTransaction.\n Local Development Environment #  We\u0026rsquo;re going to build smart contracts and run them on Ethereum, which means we need a node. Until recently, for both testing and running contracts locally you needed a node. This used to make smart contracts development somewhat tedious because running dozens (if not hundreds) tests in a real node is slow. Nowadays, luckily, we have a faster solution.\nAnother problems with solutions like Truffle and Hardhat is that we we have to use JavaScript to write tests and program interactions with the blockchain. This need comes from the fact that Truffle and Hardhat run a local node and use JavaScript Web3 libraries to interact with it.\nInstead of using Truffle or Hardhat, we\u0026rsquo;ll use Foundry.\nFoundry #  Foundry is a set of tools for Ethereum applications development. Specifically, we\u0026rsquo;re going to use:\n Forge, a testing framework for Solidity. Anvil, a local Ethereum node designed for development with Forge. We\u0026rsquo;ll use it to deploy our contracts to a local node and connect to it through the front-end app. Cast, a CLI tool with a ton of helpful features.  Forge makes smart contracts developer\u0026rsquo;s life so much easier. With Forge, we don\u0026rsquo;t need to run a local node to test contracts. Instead, Forge runs tests on its internal EVM, which is much faster and doesn\u0026rsquo;t require sending transactions and mining blocks.\nForge lets us write tests in Solidity! Forge also makes it easier to simulate blockchain state: we can easily fake our ether or token balance, execute contracts from other addresses, deploy any contracts at any address, etc.\nHowever, we\u0026rsquo;ll still need a local node to deploy our contract to. For that, we\u0026rsquo;ll use Anvil. Front-end applications use JavaScript Web3 libraries to interact with Ethereum nodes (to send transaction, query state, estimate transaction gas cost, etc.)–this is why we\u0026rsquo;ll need to run a local node.\nEthers.js #  Ethers.js is a set of Ethereum utilities written in JavaScript. This is one of the two (the other one is web3.js) most popular JavaScript libraries used in decentralized applications development. These libraries allow us to interact with an Ethereum node via the JSON-API, and they come with multiple utility functions that make developer\u0026rsquo;s life easier.\nMetaMask #  MetaMask is an Ethereum wallet in your browser. It\u0026rsquo;s a browser extension that creates and securely stores Ethereum private keys. MetaMask is the main Ethereum wallet application used by millions of users. We\u0026rsquo;ll use it to sign transactions that we\u0026rsquo;ll send to our local node.\nReact #  React is a well-known JavaScript library for building front-end applications. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to know React, I\u0026rsquo;ll provide a template application.\nSetting Up the Project #  To set up the project, create a new folder and run forge init in it:\n$ mkdir uniswapv3clone $ cd uniswapv3clone $ forge init  If you\u0026rsquo;re using Visual Studio Code, add --init flag to forge init: forge init --vscode. Forge will initialize the project with VSCode specific settings.\n Forge will create sample contracts in src, test, and script folders–these can be removed.\nTo set up the front-end application:\n$ npx create-react-app ui It\u0026rsquo;s located in a subfolder so there\u0026rsquo;s no conflict between folder names.\n"},{"id":22,"href":"/docs/milestone_1/first-swap/","title":"First Swap","section":"Milestone 1.

And, again, let\u0026rsquo;s pick and hardcode some amount of USDC we\u0026rsquo;re going to trade in for ETH. Let it be 42! We\u0026rsquo;re going to buy ETH for 42 USDC.\nAfter deciding how many tokens we want to sell, we need to calculate how many tokens we\u0026rsquo;ll get in exchange. In Uniswap V2, we would\u0026rsquo;ve used current pool reserves, but in Uniswap V3 we have $L$ and $\\sqrt{P}$ and we know the fact that, when swapping within a price range, only $\\sqrt{P}$ changes and $L$ remains unchanged (Uniswap V3 acts exactly as V2 when swapping is done only within one price range). We also know that: $$L = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta \\sqrt{P}}$$\nAnd\u0026hellip; we know $\\Delta y$! This is the 42 USDC we\u0026rsquo;re going to trade in! Thus, we can find how selling 42 USDC will affect the current $\\sqrt{P}$ given the $L$:\n$$\\Delta \\sqrt{P} = \\frac{\\Delta y}{L}$$\nIn Uniswap V3, we choose the price we want our trade to lead to (recall that swapping changes the current price, i.e. it moves the current price along the curve). Knowing the target price, the contract will calculate the amount of input token it needs to take from us and the respective amount of output token it\u0026rsquo;ll give us.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s plug in our numbers into the above formula:\n$$\\Delta \\sqrt{P} = \\frac{42 \\enspace USDC}{1517882343751509868544} = 2192253463713690532467206957$$\nAfter adding this to the current $\\sqrt{P}$, we\u0026rsquo;ll get the target price:\n$$\\sqrt{P_{target}} = \\sqrt{P_{current}} + \\Delta \\sqrt{P}$$\n$$\\sqrt{P_{target}} = 5604469350942327889444743441197$$\n To calculate the target price in Python:\namount_in = 42 * eth price_diff = (amount_in * q96) // liq price_next = sqrtp_cur + price_diff print(\u0026#34;New price:\u0026#34;, (price_next / q96) ** 2) print(\u0026#34;New sqrtP:\u0026#34;, price_next) print(\u0026#34;New tick:\u0026#34;, price_to_tick((price_next / q96) ** 2)) # New price: 5003.913912782393 # New sqrtP: 5604469350942327889444743441197 # New tick: 85184  After finding the target price, we can calculate token amounts using the amounts calculation functions from a previous chapter:\n$$ x = \\frac{L(\\sqrt{p_b}-\\sqrt{p_a})}{\\sqrt{p_b}\\sqrt{p_a}}$$ $$ y = L(\\sqrt{p_b}-\\sqrt{p_a}) $$\n In Python:\namount_in = calc_amount1(liq, price_next, sqrtp_cur) amount_out = calc_amount0(liq, price_next, sqrtp_cur)  print(\u0026#34;USDC in:\u0026#34;, amount_in / eth) print(\u0026#34;ETH out:\u0026#34;, amount_out / eth) # USDC in: 42.0 # ETH out: 0.008396714242162444  To verify the amounts, let\u0026rsquo;s recall another formula:\n$$\\Delta x = \\Delta \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{P}} L$$\nUsing this formula, we can find the amount of ETH we\u0026rsquo;re buying, $\\Delta x$, knowing the price change, $\\Delta\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{P}}$, and liquidity $L$. Be careful though: $\\Delta \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{P}}$ is not $\\frac{1}{\\Delta \\sqrt{P}}$! The former is the change of the price of ETH, and it can be found using this expression:\n$$\\Delta \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{P}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{P_{target}}} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{P_{current}}}$$\nLuckily, we already know all the values, so we can plug them in right away (this might not fit on your screen!):\n$$\\Delta \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{P}} = \\frac{1}{5604469350942327889444743441197} - \\frac{1}{5602277097478614198912276234240}$$\n$$\\Delta \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{P}} = -0.00000553186106731426$$\nNow, let\u0026rsquo;s find $\\Delta x$:\n$$\\Delta x = -0.00000553186106731426 * 1517882343751509868544 = -8396714242162698 $$\nWhich is 0.008396714242162698 ETH, and it\u0026rsquo;s very close to the amount we found above! Notice that this amount is negative since we\u0026rsquo;re removing it from the pool.\nImplementing a Swap #  Swapping is implemented in swap function:\nfunction swap(address recipient)  public  returns (int256 amount0, int256 amount1) {  ... At this moment, it only takes a recipient, who is a receiver of tokens.\nFirst, we need to find the target price and tick, as well as calculate the token amounts. Again, we\u0026rsquo;ll simply hard code the values we calculated earlier to keep things as simple as possible:\n... int24 nextTick = 85184; uint160 nextPrice = 5604469350942327889444743441197;  amount0 = -0.008396714242162444 ether; amount1 = 42 ether; ... Next, we need to update the current tick and sqrtP since trading affects the current price:\n... (slot0.tick, slot0.sqrtPriceX96) = (nextTick, nextPrice); ... Next, the contract sends tokens to the recipient and lets the caller transfer the input amount into the contract:\n... IERC20(token0).transfer(recipient, uint256(-amount0));  uint256 balance1Before = balance1(); IUniswapV3SwapCallback(msg.sender).uniswapV3SwapCallback(  amount0,  amount1 ); if (balance1Before + uint256(amount1) \u0026lt; balance1())  revert InsufficientInputAmount(); ... Again, we\u0026rsquo;re using a callback to pass the control to the caller and let it transfer the tokens. After that, we\u0026rsquo;re checking that pool\u0026rsquo;s balance is correct and includes the input amount.\nFinally, the contract emits a Swap event to make the swap discoverable. The event includes all the information about the swap:\n... emit Swap(  msg.sender,  recipient,  amount0,  amount1,  slot0.sqrtPriceX96,  liquidity,  slot0.tick ); And that\u0026rsquo;s it! The function simply sends some amount of tokens to the specified recipient address and expects a certain number of the other token in exchange. Throughout this book, the function will get much more complicated.\nTesting Swapping #  Now, we can test the swap function. In the same test file, create testSwapBuyEth function and set up the test case. This test case uses the same parameters as testMintSuccess:\nfunction testSwapBuyEth() public {  TestCaseParams memory params = TestCaseParams({  wethBalance: 1 ether,  usdcBalance: 5000 ether,  currentTick: 85176,  lowerTick: 84222,  upperTick: 86129,  liquidity: 1517882343751509868544,  currentSqrtP: 5602277097478614198912276234240,  shouldTransferInCallback: true,  mintLiqudity: true  });  (uint256 poolBalance0, uint256 poolBalance1) = setupTestCase(params);   ... Next steps will be different, however.\n We\u0026rsquo;re not going to test that liquidity has been correctly added to the pool since we tested this functionality in the other test cases.\n To make the test swap, we need 42 USDC:\ntoken1.mint(address(this), 42 ether); Before making the swap, we need to ensure we can transfer tokens to the pool contract when it requests them:\nfunction uniswapV3SwapCallback(int256 amount0, int256 amount1) public {  if (amount0 \u0026gt; 0) {  token0.transfer(msg.sender, uint256(amount0));  }   if (amount1 \u0026gt; 0) {  token1.transfer(msg.sender, uint256(amount1));  } } Since amounts during a swap can be positive (the amount that\u0026rsquo;s sent to the pool) and negative (the amount that\u0026rsquo;s taken from the pool), in the callback, we only want to send the positive amount, i.e. the amount we\u0026rsquo;re trading in.\nNow, we can call swap:\n(int256 amount0Delta, int256 amount1Delta) = pool.swap(address(this)); The function returns token amounts used in the swap, and we can check them right away:\nassertEq(amount0Delta, -0.008396714242162444 ether, \u0026#34;invalid ETH out\u0026#34;); assertEq(amount1Delta, 42 ether, \u0026#34;invalid USDC in\u0026#34;); Then, we need to ensure that tokens were actually transferred from the caller:\nassertEq(  token0.balanceOf(address(this)),  uint256(userBalance0Before - amount0Delta),  \u0026#34;invalid user ETH balance\u0026#34; ); assertEq(  token1.balanceOf(address(this)),  0,  \u0026#34;invalid user USDC balance\u0026#34; ); And sent to the pool contract:\nassertEq(  token0.balanceOf(address(pool)),  uint256(int256(poolBalance0) + amount0Delta),  \u0026#34;invalid pool ETH balance\u0026#34; ); assertEq(  token1.balanceOf(address(pool)),  uint256(int256(poolBalance1) + amount1Delta),  \u0026#34;invalid pool USDC balance\u0026#34; ); Finally, we\u0026rsquo;re checking that the pool state was updated correctly:\n(uint160 sqrtPriceX96, int24 tick) = pool.slot0(); assertEq(  sqrtPriceX96,  5604469350942327889444743441197,  \u0026#34;invalid current sqrtP\u0026#34; ); assertEq(tick, 85184, \u0026#34;invalid current tick\u0026#34;); assertEq(  pool.liquidity(),  1517882343751509868544,  \u0026#34;invalid current liquidity\u0026#34; ); Notice that swapping doesn\u0026rsquo;t change the current liquidity–in a later chapter, we\u0026rsquo;ll see when it does change it.\nHomework #  Write a test that fails with InsufficientInputAmount error. Keep in mind that there\u0026rsquo;s a hidden bug 🙂\n"},{"id":23,"href":"/docs/milestone_4/multi-pool-swaps/","title":"Multi-pool Swaps","section":"Milestone 4. Multi-pool Swaps","content":"Multi-pool Swaps #  We\u0026rsquo;re now proceeding to the core of this milestone–implementing multi-pool swaps in our contracts. We won\u0026rsquo;t touch Pool contract in this milestone because it\u0026rsquo;s a core contract that should implement only core features. Multi-pool swaps is a utility feature, and we\u0026rsquo;ll implement it in Manager and Quoter contracts.\nUpdating Manager Contract #  Single-pool and Multi-pool Swaps #  In our current implementation, swap function in Manager contract supports only single-pool swaps and takes pool address in parameters:\nfunction swap(  address poolAddress_,  bool zeroForOne,  uint256 amountSpecified,  uint160 sqrtPriceLimitX96,  bytes calldata data ) public returns (int256, int256) { ... } We\u0026rsquo;re going to split it into two functions: single-pool swap and multi-pool swap. These functions will have different set of parameters:\nstruct SwapSingleParams {  address tokenIn;  address tokenOut;  uint24 tickSpacing;  uint256 amountIn;  uint160 sqrtPriceLimitX96; }  struct SwapParams {  bytes path;  address recipient;  uint256 amountIn;  uint256 minAmountOut; }  SwapSingleParams takes pool parameters, input amount, and a limiting price–this is pretty much identical to what we had before. Notice, that data is no longer required. SwapParams takes path, output amount recipient, input amount, and minimal output amount. The latter parameter replaces sqrtPriceLimitX96 because, when doing multi-pool swaps, we cannot use the slippage protection from Pool contract (which uses a limiting price). We need to implement another slippage protection, which checks the final output amount and compares it with minAmountOut: the slippage protection fails when the final output amount is smaller than minAmountOut.  Core Swapping Logic #  Let\u0026rsquo;s implement an internal _swap function that will be called by both single- and multi-pool swap functions. It\u0026rsquo;ll prepare parameters and call Pool.swap.\nfunction _swap(  uint256 amountIn,  address recipient,  uint160 sqrtPriceLimitX96,  SwapCallbackData memory data ) internal returns (uint256 amountOut) {  ... SwapCallbackData is a new data structure that contains data we pass between swap functions and uniswapV3SwapCallback:\nstruct SwapCallbackData {  bytes path;  address payer; } path is a swap path and payer is the address that provides input tokens in swaps–we\u0026rsquo;ll have different payers during multi-pool swaps.\nFirst thing we do in _swap, is extracting pool parameters using Path library:\n// function _swap(...) { (address tokenIn, address tokenOut, uint24 tickSpacing) = data  .path  .decodeFirstPool(); Then we identify swap direction:\nbool zeroForOne = tokenIn \u0026lt; tokenOut; Then we make the actual swap:\n// function _swap(...) { (int256 amount0, int256 amount1) = getPool(  tokenIn,  tokenOut,  tickSpacing ).swap(  recipient,  zeroForOne,  amountIn,  sqrtPriceLimitX96 == 0  ? (  zeroForOne  ? TickMath.MIN_SQRT_RATIO + 1  : TickMath.MAX_SQRT_RATIO - 1  )  : sqrtPriceLimitX96,  abi.encode(data)  ); This piece is identical to what we had before but this time we\u0026rsquo;re calling getPool to find the pool. getPool is a function that sorts tokens and calls PoolAddress.computeAddress:\nfunction getPool(  address token0,  address token1,  uint24 tickSpacing ) internal view returns (IUniswapV3Pool pool) {  (token0, token1) = token0 \u0026lt; token1  ? (token0, token1)  : (token1, token0);  pool = IUniswapV3Pool(  PoolAddress.computeAddress(factory, token0, token1, tickSpacing)  ); } After making a swap, we need to figure out which of the amounts is the output one:\n// function _swap(...) { amountOut = uint256(-(zeroForOne ? amount1 : amount0)); And that\u0026rsquo;s it. Let\u0026rsquo;s now look at how single-pool swap works.\nSingle-pool Swapping #  swapSingle acts simply as a wrapper of _swap:\nfunction swapSingle(SwapSingleParams calldata params)  public  returns (uint256 amountOut) {  amountOut = _swap(  params.amountIn,  msg.sender,  params.sqrtPriceLimitX96,  SwapCallbackData({  path: abi.encodePacked(  params.tokenIn,  params.tickSpacing,  params.tokenOut  ),  payer: msg.sender  })  ); } Notice that we\u0026rsquo;re building a one-pool path here: single-pool swap is a multi-pool swap with one pool 🙂.\nMulti-pool Swapping #  Multi-pool swapping is only slightly more difficult than single-pool swapping. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at it:\nfunction swap(SwapParams memory params) public returns (uint256 amountOut) {  address payer = msg.sender;  bool hasMultiplePools;  ... First swap is paid by user because it\u0026rsquo;s user who provides input tokens.\nThen, we start iterating over pools in the path:\n... while (true) {  hasMultiplePools = params.path.hasMultiplePools();   params.amountIn = _swap(  params.amountIn,  hasMultiplePools ? address(this) : params.recipient,  0,  SwapCallbackData({  path: params.path.getFirstPool(),  payer: payer  })  );  ... In each iteration, we\u0026rsquo;re calling _swap with these parameters:\n params.amountIn tracks input amounts. During the first swap it\u0026rsquo;s the amount provided by user. During next swaps its the amounts returned from previous swaps. hasMultiplePools ? address(this) : params.recipient–if there are multiple pools in the path, recipient is the manager contract, it\u0026rsquo;ll store tokens between swaps. If there\u0026rsquo;s only one pool (last one) in the path, recipient is the one specified in the parameters (usually the same user that initiates the swap). sqrtPriceLimitX96 is set to 0 to disable slippage protection in the Pool contract. Last parameter is what we pass to uniswapV3SwapCallback–we\u0026rsquo;ll look at it shortly.  After making one swap, we need to proceed to next pool in a path or return:\n ...   if (hasMultiplePools) {  payer = address(this);  params.path = params.path.skipToken();  } else {  amountOut = params.amountIn;  break;  } } This is where we\u0026rsquo;re changing payer and removing a processed pool from the path.\nFinally, the new slippage protection:\nif (amountOut \u0026lt; params.minAmountOut)  revert TooLittleReceived(amountOut); Swap Callback #  Let\u0026rsquo;s look at the updated swap callback:\nfunction uniswapV3SwapCallback(  int256 amount0,  int256 amount1,  bytes calldata data_ ) public {  SwapCallbackData memory data = abi.decode(data_, (SwapCallbackData));  (address tokenIn, address tokenOut, ) = data.path.decodeFirstPool();   bool zeroForOne = tokenIn \u0026lt; tokenOut;   int256 amount = zeroForOne ? amount0 : amount1;   if (data.payer == address(this)) {  IERC20(tokenIn).transfer(msg.sender, uint256(amount));  } else {  IERC20(tokenIn).transferFrom(  data.payer,  msg.sender,  uint256(amount)  );  } } The callback expects encoded SwapCallbackData with path and payer address. It extracts pool tokens from the path, figures out swap direction (zeroForOne), and the amount the contract needs to transfer out. Then, it acts differently depending on payer address:\n If payer is the current contract (this is so when making consecutive swaps), it transfers tokens to the next pool (the one that called this callback) from current contract\u0026rsquo;s balance. If payer is a different address (the user that initiated the swap), it transfers tokens from user\u0026rsquo;s balance.  Updating Quoter Contract #  Quoter is another contract that needs to be updated because we want to use it to also find output amounts in multi-pool swaps. Similarly to Manager, we\u0026rsquo;ll have two variants of quote function: single-pool and multi-pool one. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at the former first.\nSingle-pool Quoting #  We need to make only a couple of changes in our current quote implementation:\n rename it to quoteSingle; extract parameters into a struct (this is mostly a cosmetic change); instead of a pool address, take a token address and a tick spacing in the parameters.  // src/UniswapV3Quoter.sol struct QuoteSingleParams {  address tokenIn;  address tokenOut;  uint24 tickSpacing;  uint256 amountIn;  uint160 sqrtPriceLimitX96; }  function quoteSingle(QuoteSingleParams memory params)  public  returns (  uint256 amountOut,  uint160 sqrtPriceX96After,  int24 tickAfter  ) {  ... And the only change we have in the body of the function is usage of getPool to find pool address:\n ...  IUniswapV3Pool pool = getPool(  params.tokenIn,  params.tokenOut,  params.tickSpacing  );   bool zeroForOne = params.tokenIn \u0026lt; params.tokenOut;  ... Multi-pool Quoting #  Multi-pool quoting implementation is similar to the multi-pool swapping one, but it uses fewer parameters.\nfunction quote(bytes memory path, uint256 amountIn)  public  returns (  uint256 amountOut,  uint160[] memory sqrtPriceX96AfterList,  int24[] memory tickAfterList  ) {  sqrtPriceX96AfterList = new uint160[](path.numPools());  tickAfterList = new int24[](path.numPools());  ... As parameters, we only need input amount and swap path. The function returns similar values as quoteSingle, but \u0026ldquo;price after\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;tick after\u0026rdquo; are collected after each swap, thus we need to returns arrays.\nuint256 i = 0; while (true) {  (address tokenIn, address tokenOut, uint24 tickSpacing) = path  .decodeFirstPool();   (  uint256 amountOut_,  uint160 sqrtPriceX96After,  int24 tickAfter  ) = quoteSingle(  QuoteSingleParams({  tokenIn: tokenIn,  tokenOut: tokenOut,  tickSpacing: tickSpacing,  amountIn: amountIn,  sqrtPriceLimitX96: 0  })  );   sqrtPriceX96AfterList[i] = sqrtPriceX96After;  tickAfterList[i] = tickAfter;  amountIn = amountOut_;  i++;   if (path.hasMultiplePools()) {  path = path.skipToken();  } else {  amountOut = amountIn;  break;  } } The logic of the loop is identical to the one in the updated swap function:\n get current pool\u0026rsquo;s parameters; call quoteSingle on current pool; save returned values; repeat if there\u0026rsquo;re more pools in the path, or return otherwise.

The fields that will be filled uniquely for each token:\n the color of the background, which is set in the first two rects; the hue component (330 in the template) will be unique for each token; the names of the tokens of a pool the position belongs to (WETH/USDC in the template); the fee of a pool (0.05%); tick values of the boundaries of the position (123456).  Here are examples of NFTs our contract will be able to produce:\nDependencies #  Solidity doesn\u0026rsquo;t provide native Base64 encoding tool so we\u0026rsquo;ll use a third-party one. Specifically, we\u0026rsquo;ll use the one from OpenZeppelin.\nAnother tedious thing about Solidity is that is has very poor support for operations with strings. For example, there\u0026rsquo;s no way to convert integers to strings–but we need that to render pool fee and position ticks in the SVG template. We\u0026rsquo;ll use the Strings library from OpenZeppelin to do that.\nFormat of the Result #  The data produced by the renderer will have this format:\ndata:application/json;base64,BASE64_ENCODED_JSON The JSON will look like that:\n{  \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Uniswap V3 Position\u0026#34;,  \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;USDC/DAI 0.05%, Lower tick: -520, Upper text: 490\u0026#34;,  \u0026#34;image\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;BASE64_ENCODED_SVG\u0026#34; } The image will be the above SVG template filled with position data and encoded in Base64.\nImplementing the Renderer #  We\u0026rsquo;ll implement the renderer in a separate library contract to not make the NFT manager contract too noisy:\nlibrary NFTRenderer {  struct RenderParams {  address pool;  address owner;  int24 lowerTick;  int24 upperTick;  uint24 fee;  }   function render(RenderParams memory params) {  ...  } } In the render function, we\u0026rsquo;ll first render an SVG, then a JSON. To keep the code cleaner, we\u0026rsquo;ll break down each step into smaller steps.\nWe begin with fetching token symbols:\nfunction render(RenderParams memory params) {  IUniswapV3Pool pool = IUniswapV3Pool(params.pool);  IERC20 token0 = IERC20(pool.token0());  IERC20 token1 = IERC20(pool.token1());  string memory symbol0 = token0.symbol();  string memory symbol1 = token1.symbol();   ...

The background is simply two rects.

Strings.toString(uint256(uint24(-tick)))  : Strings.toString(uint256(uint24(tick)))  ); } JSON Rendering #  Now, let\u0026rsquo;s return to the render function and render the JSON. First, we need to render a token description:\nfunction render(RenderParams memory params) {  ... SVG rendering ...   string memory description = renderDescription(  symbol0,  symbol1,  params.fee,  params.lowerTick,  params.upperTick  );   ... Token description is a text string that contains all the same information that we render in token\u0026rsquo;s SVG:\nfunction renderDescription(  string memory symbol0,  string memory symbol1,  uint24 fee,  int24 lowerTick,  int24 upperTick ) internal pure returns (string memory description) {  description = string.concat(  symbol0,  \u0026#34;/\u0026#34;,  symbol1,  \u0026#34; \u0026#34;,  feeToText(fee),  \u0026#34;, Lower tick: \u0026#34;,  tickToText(lowerTick),  \u0026#34;, Upper text: \u0026#34;,  tickToText(upperTick)  ); } We can now assemble the JSON metadata:\nfunction render(RenderParams memory params) {  string memory image = ...SVG rendering...  string memory description = ...description rendering...   string memory json = string.concat(  \u0026#39;{\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Uniswap V3 Position\u0026#34;,\u0026#39;,  \u0026#39;\u0026#34;description\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#39;,  description,  \u0026#39;\u0026#34;,\u0026#39;,  \u0026#39;\u0026#34;image\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;data:image/svg+xml;base64,\u0026#39;,  Base64.encode(bytes(image)),  \u0026#39;\u0026#34;}\u0026#39;  ); And, finally, we can return the result:\nreturn  string.concat(  \u0026#34;data:application/json;base64,\u0026#34;,  Base64.encode(bytes(json))  ); Filling the Gap in tokenURI #  Now we\u0026rsquo;re ready to return to the tokenURI function in the NFT manager contract and add the actual rendering:\nfunction tokenURI(uint256 tokenId)  public  view  override  returns (string memory) {  TokenPosition memory tokenPosition = positions[tokenId];  if (tokenPosition.pool == address(0x00)) revert WrongToken();   IUniswapV3Pool pool = IUniswapV3Pool(tokenPosition.pool);   return  NFTRenderer.render(  NFTRenderer.RenderParams({  pool: tokenPosition.pool,  owner: address(this),  lowerTick: tokenPosition.lowerTick,  upperTick: tokenPosition.upperTick,  fee: pool.fee()  })  ); } Gas Costs #  With all its benefits, storing data on-chain has a huge disadvantage: contract deployments become very expensive. When deploying a contract, you pay for the size of the contract, and all the strings and templates increase gas spending significantly. This gets even worse the more advanced your SVGs are: the more there are shapes, CSS styles, animations, etc. the more expensive it gets.\nKeep in mind that the NFT renderer we implemented above is not gas optimized: you can see the repetitive rect and text tag strings that can be extracted into internal functions. I sacrificed gas efficiency for the readability of the contract. In real NFT projects that store all data on-chain, code readability is usually very poor due to heavy gas cost optimizations.\nTesting #  The last thing I wanted to focus here is how we can test the NFT images. It\u0026rsquo;s very important to keep all changes in NFT images tracked to ensure no change breaks rendering. For this, we need a way to test the output of tokenURI and its different variations (we can even pre-render the whole collection and have tests to ensure no image get broken during development).\nTo test the output of tokenURI, I added this custom assertion:\nassertTokenURI(  nft.tokenURI(tokenId0),  \u0026#34;tokenuri0\u0026#34;,  \u0026#34;invalid token URI\u0026#34; ); The first argument is the actual output and the second argument is the name of the file that stores the expected one. The assertion loads the content of the file and compares it with the actual one:\nfunction assertTokenURI(  string memory actual,  string memory expectedFixture,  string memory errMessage ) internal {  string memory expected = vm.readFile(  string.concat(\u0026#34;./test/fixtures/\u0026#34;, expectedFixture)  );   assertEq(actual, string(expected), errMessage); } We can do this in Solidity thanks to the vm.readFile() cheat code provided by forge-std library, which is a helper library that comes with Forge. Not only this is simple and convenient, this is also secure: we can configure filesystem permissions to allow only permitted file operations. Specifically, to make the above test work, we need to add this fs_permissions rule to foundry.toml:\nfs_permissions = [{access=\u0026#39;read\u0026#39;,path=\u0026#39;.\u0026#39;}] And this is how you can read the SVG from a tokenURI fixture:\n$ cat test/fixtures/tokenuri0 \\  | awk -F \u0026#39;,\u0026#39; \u0026#39;{print $2}\u0026#39; \\  | base64 -d - \\  | jq -r .image \\  | awk -F \u0026#39;,\u0026#39; \u0026#39;{print $2}\u0026#39; \\  | base64 -d - \u0026gt; nft.svg \\  \u0026amp;\u0026amp; open nft.svg  Ensure you have jq tool installed.\n "},{"id":25,"href":"/docs/milestone_5/protocol-fees/","title":"Protocol Fees","section":"Milestone 5.

Neither traders, nor liquidity providers pay Uniswap Labs for using the Uniswap DEX. How come?\nIn fact, there\u0026rsquo;s a way for Uniswap Labs to start making money on the DEX. However, the mechanism hasn\u0026rsquo;t been enabled yet (again, as of September 2022). Each Uniswap pool has protocol fees collection mechanism. Protocol fees are collected from swap fees: a small portion of swap fees is subtracted and saved as protocol fees to later be collected by Factory contract owner (Uniswap Labs). The size of protocol fees is expected to be determined by UNI token holders, but it must be between $1/4$ and $1/10$ (inclusive) of swap fees.\nFor brevity, we\u0026rsquo;re not going to add protocol fees to our implementation, but let\u0026rsquo;s see how they\u0026rsquo;re implemented in Uniswap.\nProtocol fee size is stored in slot0:\n// UniswapV3Pool.sol struct Slot0 {  ...  // the current protocol fee as a percentage of the swap fee taken on withdrawal  // represented as an integer denominator (1/x)%  uint8 feeProtocol;  ... } And a global accumulator is needed to track accrued fees:\n// accumulated protocol fees in token0/token1 units struct ProtocolFees {  uint128 token0;  uint128 token1; } ProtocolFees public override protocolFees; Protocol fees are set in the setFeeProtocol function:\nfunction setFeeProtocol(uint8 feeProtocol0, uint8 feeProtocol1) external override lock onlyFactoryOwner {  require(  (feeProtocol0 == 0 || (feeProtocol0 \u0026gt;= 4 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; feeProtocol0 \u0026lt;= 10)) \u0026amp;\u0026amp;  (feeProtocol1 == 0 || (feeProtocol1 \u0026gt;= 4 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; feeProtocol1 \u0026lt;= 10))  );  uint8 feeProtocolOld = slot0.feeProtocol;  slot0.feeProtocol = feeProtocol0 + (feeProtocol1 \u0026lt;\u0026lt; 4);  emit SetFeeProtocol(feeProtocolOld % 16, feeProtocolOld \u0026gt;\u0026gt; 4, feeProtocol0, feeProtocol1); } As you can see, it\u0026rsquo;s allowed to set protocol fees separate for each of the tokens. The values are two uint8 that are packed to be stored in one uint8: feeProtocol1 is shifted to the left by 4 bits (this is identical to multiplying it by 16) and added to feeProtocol0. To unpack feeProtocol0, a remainder of division slot0.feeProtocol by 16 is taken; feeProtocol1 is simply integer division of slot0.feeProtocol by 4. Such packing works because neither feeProtocol0, nor feeProtocol1 can be greater than 10.\nBefore beginning a swap, we need to choose one of the protocol fees depending on swap direction (swap and protocol fees are collected on input tokens):\nfunction swap(...) {  ...  uint8 feeProtocol = zeroForOne ? (slot0_.feeProtocol % 16) : (slot0_.feeProtocol \u0026gt;\u0026gt; 4);  ... To accrue protocol fees, we subtract them from swap fees right after computing swap step amounts:\n... while (...) {  (..., step.feeAmount) = SwapMath.computeSwapStep(...);   if (cache.feeProtocol \u0026gt; 0) {  uint256 delta = step.feeAmount / cache.feeProtocol;  step.feeAmount -= delta;  state.protocolFee += uint128(delta);  }   ... } ... After a swap is done, the global protocol fees accumulator needs to be updated:\nif (zeroForOne) {  if (state.protocolFee \u0026gt; 0) protocolFees.token0 += state.protocolFee; } else {  if (state.protocolFee \u0026gt; 0) protocolFees.token1 += state.protocolFee; } Finally, Factory contract owner can collect accrued protocol fees by calling collectProtocol:\nfunction collectProtocol(  address recipient,  uint128 amount0Requested,  uint128 amount1Requested ) external override lock onlyFactoryOwner returns (uint128 amount0, uint128 amount1) {  amount0 = amount0Requested \u0026gt; protocolFees.token0 ? protocolFees.token0 : amount0Requested;  amount1 = amount1Requested \u0026gt; protocolFees.token1 ? protocolFees.token1 : amount1Requested;   if (amount0 \u0026gt; 0) {  if (amount0 == protocolFees.token0) amount0--;  protocolFees.token0 -= amount0;  TransferHelper.safeTransfer(token0, recipient, amount0);  }  if (amount1 \u0026gt; 0) {  if (amount1 == protocolFees.token1) amount1--;  protocolFees.token1 -= amount1;  TransferHelper.safeTransfer(token1, recipient, amount1);  }   emit CollectProtocol(msg.sender, recipient, amount0, amount1); } "},{"id":26,"href":"/docs/milestone_3/slippage-protection/","title":"Slippage Protection","section":"Milestone 3.

Slippage simply means the difference between the price that you see on the screen when initialing a transaction and the actual price the swap is executed at. This difference appears because there\u0026rsquo;s a short (and sometimes long, depending on network congestion and gas costs) delay between when you send a transaction and when it gets mined. In more technical terms, blockchain state changes every block and there\u0026rsquo;s no guarantee that your transaction will be applied at a specific block.\nAnother important problem that slippage protection fixes is sandwich attacks–this is a common type of attacks on decentralized exchange users. During sandwiching, attackers \u0026ldquo;wrap\u0026rdquo; your swap transactions in their two transactions: one goes before your transaction and the other goes after it. In the first transaction, an attacker modifier the state of a pool so that your swap becomes very unprofitable for you and somewhat profitable for the attacker. This is achieved by adjusting pool liquidity so that your trade happens at a lower price. In the second transaction, the attacker reestablishes pool liquidity and the price. As a result, you get much less tokens than expected due to manipulated prices, and the attacker get some profit.\nThe way slippage protection is implemented in decentralized exchanges is by letting user choose how far the actual price is allowed to drop. By default, Uniswap V3 sets slippage tolerance to 0.1%, which means a swap is executed only if the price at the moment of execution is not smaller than 99.9% of the price the user saw in the browser. This is a very tight range and users are allowed to adjust this number, which is useful when volatility is high.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s add slippage protection to our implementation!\nSlippage Protection in Swaps #  To protect swaps, we need to add one more parameter to swap function–we want to let user choose a stop price, a price at which swapping will stop. We\u0026rsquo;ll call the parameter sqrtPriceLimitX96:\nfunction swap(  address recipient,  bool zeroForOne,  uint256 amountSpecified,  uint160 sqrtPriceLimitX96,  bytes calldata data ) public returns (int256 amount0, int256 amount1) {  ...  if (  zeroForOne  ? sqrtPriceLimitX96 \u0026gt; slot0_.sqrtPriceX96 ||  sqrtPriceLimitX96 \u0026lt; TickMath.MIN_SQRT_RATIO  : sqrtPriceLimitX96 \u0026lt; slot0_.sqrtPriceX96 \u0026amp;\u0026amp;  sqrtPriceLimitX96 \u0026gt; TickMath.MAX_SQRT_RATIO  ) revert InvalidPriceLimit();  ... When selling token $x$ (zeroForOne is true), sqrtPriceLimitX96 must be between the current price and the minimal $\\sqrt{P}$ since selling token $x$ moves the price down. Likewise, when selling token $y$, sqrtPriceLimitX96 must be between the current price and the maximal $\\sqrt{P}$ because price moves up.\nIn the while loop, we want to satisfy two conditions: full swap amount is filled and current price isn\u0026rsquo;t equal to sqrtPriceLimitX96:\n.. while (  state.amountSpecifiedRemaining \u0026gt; 0 \u0026amp;\u0026amp;  state.sqrtPriceX96 != sqrtPriceLimitX96 ) { ... Which means that Uniswap V3 pools don\u0026rsquo;t fail when slippage tolerance gets hit and simply executes swap partially.\nAnother place where we need to consider sqrtPriceLimitX96 is when calling SwapMath.computeSwapStep:\n(state.sqrtPriceX96, step.amountIn, step.amountOut) = SwapMath  .computeSwapStep(  state.sqrtPriceX96,  (  zeroForOne  ? step.sqrtPriceNextX96 \u0026lt; sqrtPriceLimitX96  : step.sqrtPriceNextX96 \u0026gt; sqrtPriceLimitX96  )  ? sqrtPriceLimitX96  : step.sqrtPriceNextX96,  state.liquidity,  state.amountSpecifiedRemaining  ); Here, we want to ensure that computeSwapStep never calculates swap amounts outside of sqrtPriceLimitX96–this guarantees that the current price will never cross the limiting price.\nSlippage Protection in Minting #  Adding liquidity also requires slippage protection. This comes from the fact that price cannot be changed when adding liquidity (liquidity must be proportional to current price), thus liquidity providers also suffer from slippage. Unlike swap function however, we\u0026rsquo;re not forced to implement slippage protection in Pool contract–recall that Pool contract is a core contract and we don\u0026rsquo;t want to put unnecessary logic into it. This is why we made the Manager contract, and it\u0026rsquo;s in the Manager contract where we\u0026rsquo;ll implement slippage protection.\nThe Manager contract is a wrapper contract that makes calls to Pool contract more convenient. To implement slippage protection in the mint function, we can simply check the amounts of tokens taken by Pool and compare them to some minimal amounts chosen by user. Additionally, we can free users from calculating $\\sqrt{P_{lower}}$ and $\\sqrt{P_{upper}}$, as well as liquidity, and calculate these in Manager.mint().\nOur updated mint function will now take more parameters, so let\u0026rsquo;s group them in a struct:\n// src/UniswapV3Manager.sol contract UniswapV3Manager {  struct MintParams {  address poolAddress;  int24 lowerTick;  int24 upperTick;  uint256 amount0Desired;  uint256 amount1Desired;  uint256 amount0Min;  uint256 amount1Min;  }   function mint(MintParams calldata params)  public  returns (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1)  {  ... amount0Min and amount1Min are the amounts that are calculated based on slippage tolerance. They must be smaller than the desired amounts, with the gap controlled by the slippage tolerance setting. Liquidity provider expect to provide amounts not smaller than amount0Min and amount1Min.\nNext, we calculate $\\sqrt{P_{lower}}$, $\\sqrt{P_{upper}}$, and liquidity:\n... IUniswapV3Pool pool = IUniswapV3Pool(params.poolAddress);  (uint160 sqrtPriceX96, ) = pool.slot0(); uint160 sqrtPriceLowerX96 = TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(  params.lowerTick ); uint160 sqrtPriceUpperX96 = TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(  params.upperTick );  uint128 liquidity = LiquidityMath.getLiquidityForAmounts(  sqrtPriceX96,  sqrtPriceLowerX96,  sqrtPriceUpperX96,  params.amount0Desired,  params.amount1Desired ); ... LiquidityMath.getLiquidityForAmounts is a new function, we\u0026rsquo;ll discuss it in the next chapter.\nNext step is to provide liquidity to the pool and check the amounts returned by the pool: if they\u0026rsquo;re too low, we revert.\n(amount0, amount1) = pool.mint(  msg.sender,  params.lowerTick,  params.upperTick,  liquidity,  abi.encode(  IUniswapV3Pool.CallbackData({  token0: pool.token0(),  token1: pool.token1(),  payer: msg.sender  })  ) );  if (amount0 \u0026lt; params.amount0Min || amount1 \u0026lt; params.amount1Min)  revert SlippageCheckFailed(amount0, amount1); That\u0026rsquo;s it!\n"},{"id":27,"href":"/docs/milestone_2/tick-bitmap-index/","title":"Tick Bitmap Index","section":"Milestone 2.

We then say that 0 means a flag is not set and 1 means it\u0026rsquo;s set. So what we get is a very compact array of indexed flags: each byte can fit 8 flags. In Solidity, we can have integers up to 256 bits, which means one uint256 can hold 256 flags.\nUniswap V3 uses this technique to store the information about initialized ticks, that is ticks with some liquidity. When a flag is set (1), the tick has liquidity; when a flag is not set (0), the tick is not initialized. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at the implementation.\nTickBitmap Contract #  In the pool contract, the tick index is stored in a state variable:\ncontract UniswapV3Pool {  using TickBitmap for mapping(int16 =\u0026gt; uint256);  mapping(int16 =\u0026gt; uint256) public tickBitmap;  ... } This is mapping where keys are int16\u0026rsquo;s and values are words (uint256). Imagine an infinite continuous array of ones and zeros:\nEach element in this array corresponds to a tick. To navigate in this array, we break it into words: sub-arrays of length 256 bits. To find tick\u0026rsquo;s position in this array, we do:\nfunction position(int24 tick) private pure returns (int16 wordPos, uint8 bitPos) {  wordPos = int16(tick \u0026gt;\u0026gt; 8);  bitPos = uint8(uint24(tick % 256)); } That is: we find its word position and then its bit in this word. \u0026gt;\u0026gt; 8 is identical to integer division by 256. So, word position is the integer part of a tick index divided by 256, and bit position is the remainder.\nAs an example, let\u0026rsquo;s calculate word and bit positions for one of our ticks:\ntick = 85176 word_pos = tick \u0026gt;\u0026gt; 8 # or tick // 2**8 bit_pos = tick % 256 print(f\u0026#34;Word {word_pos}, bit {bit_pos}\u0026#34;) # Word 332, bit 184 Flipping Flags #  When adding liquidity into a pool, we need to set a couple of tick flags in the bitmap: one for the lower tick and one for the upper tick. We do this in flipTick method of the bitmap mapping:\nfunction flipTick(  mapping(int16 =\u0026gt; uint256) storage self,  int24 tick,  int24 tickSpacing ) internal {  require(tick % tickSpacing == 0); // ensure that the tick is spaced  (int16 wordPos, uint8 bitPos) = position(tick / tickSpacing);  uint256 mask = 1 \u0026lt;\u0026lt; bitPos;  self[wordPos] ^= mask; }  Until later in the book, tickSpacing is always 1.\n After finding word and bit positions, we need to make a mask. A mask is a number that has a single 1 flag set at the bit position of the tick. To find the mask, we simply calculate 2**bit_pos (equivalent of 1 \u0026lt;\u0026lt; bit_pos):\nmask = 2**bit_pos # or 1 \u0026lt;\u0026lt; bit_pos print(bin(mask)) #0b10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 Next, to flip a flag, we apply the mask to the tick\u0026rsquo;s word via bitwise XOR:\nword = (2**256) - 1 # set word to all ones print(bin(word ^ mask)) ↓ here #0b1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111101111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 You\u0026rsquo;ll see that 184th bit (counting from the right starting at 0) has flipped to 0.\nIf a bit is zero, it\u0026rsquo;ll set it to 1:\nword = 0 print(bin(word ^ mask)) #0b10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 Finding Next Tick #  Next step is finding ticks with liquidity using the bitmap index.\nDuring swapping, we need to find a tick with liquidity that\u0026rsquo;s before or after the current tick (that is: to the left or to the right of it). In the previous milestone, we used to calculate and hard code it, but now we need to find such tick using the bitmap index. We\u0026rsquo;ll do this in the TickMath.nextInitializedTickWithinOneWord function. In this function, we\u0026rsquo;ll need to implement two scenarios:\n When selling token $x$ (ETH in our case), find next initialized tick in the current tick\u0026rsquo;s word and to the right of the current tick. When selling token $y$ (USDC in our case), find next initialized tick in the next (current + 1) tick\u0026rsquo;s word and to the left of the current tick.  This corresponds to the price movement when making swaps in either directions:\n Be aware that, in the code, the direction is flipped: when buying token $x$, we search for initialized ticks to the left of the current; when selling token $x$, we search ticks to the right. But this is only true within a word; words are ordered from left to right.\n When there\u0026rsquo;s no initialized tick in the current word, we\u0026rsquo;ll continue searching in an adjacent word in the next loop cycle.\nNow, let\u0026rsquo;s look at the implementation:\nfunction nextInitializedTickWithinOneWord(  mapping(int16 =\u0026gt; uint256) storage self,  int24 tick,  int24 tickSpacing,  bool lte ) internal view returns (int24 next, bool initialized) {  int24 compressed = tick / tickSpacing;  ...  First arguments makes this function a method of mapping(int16 =\u0026gt; uint256). tick is the current tick. tickSpacing is always 1 until we start using it in Milestone 4. lte is the flag that sets the direction. When true, we\u0026rsquo;re selling token $x$ and searching for next initialized tick to the right of the current one. When false, it\u0026rsquo;s the other way around. lte equals to the swap direction: true when selling token $x$, false otherwise.  if (lte) {  (int16 wordPos, uint8 bitPos) = position(compressed);  uint256 mask = (1 \u0026lt;\u0026lt; bitPos) - 1 + (1 \u0026lt;\u0026lt; bitPos);  uint256 masked = self[wordPos] \u0026amp; mask;  ... When selling $x$, we\u0026rsquo;re:\n taking current tick\u0026rsquo;s word and bit positions; making a mask where all bits to the right of the current bit position, including it, are ones (mask is all ones, its length = bitPos); applying the mask to the current tick\u0026rsquo;s word.   ...  initialized = masked != 0;  next = initialized  ? (compressed - int24(uint24(bitPos - BitMath.mostSignificantBit(masked)))) * tickSpacing  : (compressed - int24(uint24(bitPos))) * tickSpacing;  ... Next, masked won\u0026rsquo;t equal 0 if at least one bit of it is set to 1. If so, there\u0026rsquo;s an initialized tick; if not, there isn\u0026rsquo;t (not in the current word). Depending on the result, we either return the index of the next initialized tick or the leftmost bit in the next word–this will allow to search for initialized ticks in the word during another loop cycle.\n ... } else {  (int16 wordPos, uint8 bitPos) = position(compressed + 1);  uint256 mask = ~((1 \u0026lt;\u0026lt; bitPos) - 1);  uint256 masked = self[wordPos] \u0026amp; mask;  ... Similarly, when selling $y$, we\u0026rsquo;re:\n taking next tick\u0026rsquo;s word and bit positions; making a different mask, where all bits to the left of next tick bit position are ones and all the bits to the right are zeros; applying the mask to the next tick\u0026rsquo;s word.  Again, if there\u0026rsquo;s no initialized ticks to the left, the rightmost bit of the previous word is returned:\n ...  initialized = masked != 0;  // overflow/underflow is possible, but prevented externally by limiting both tickSpacing and tick  next = initialized  ? (compressed + 1 + int24(uint24((BitMath.leastSignificantBit(masked) - bitPos)))) * tickSpacing  : (compressed + 1 + int24(uint24((type(uint8).max - bitPos)))) * tickSpacing; } And that\u0026rsquo;s it!\nAs you can see, nextInitializedTickWithinOneWord doesn\u0026rsquo;t find the exact tick if it\u0026rsquo;s far away–it\u0026rsquo;s scope of search is current or next tick\u0026rsquo;s word. Indeed, we don\u0026rsquo;t want to iterate over the infinite bitmap index.\n"},{"id":28,"href":"/docs/milestone_2/generalize-minting/","title":"Generalize Minting","section":"Milestone 2.

Now, we also need to index newly initialized ticks in the bitmap index–we\u0026rsquo;ll later use this index to find next initialized tick during swapping.\nFirst, we need to update Tick.update function:\n// src/lib/Tick.sol function update(  mapping(int24 =\u0026gt; Tick.Info) storage self,  int24 tick,  uint128 liquidityDelta ) internal returns (bool flipped) {  ...  flipped = (liquidityAfter == 0) != (liquidityBefore == 0);  ... } It now returns flipped flag, which is set to true when liquidity is added to an empty tick or when entire liquidity is removed from a tick.\nThen, in mint function, we update the bitmap index:\n// src/UniswapV3Pool.sol ... bool flippedLower = ticks.update(lowerTick, amount); bool flippedUpper = ticks.update(upperTick, amount);  if (flippedLower) {  tickBitmap.flipTick(lowerTick, 1); }  if (flippedUpper) {  tickBitmap.flipTick(upperTick, 1); } ...  Again, we\u0026rsquo;re setting tick spacing to 1 until we introduce different values in Milestone 4.\n Token Amounts Calculation #  The biggest change in mint function is switching to tokens amount calculation. In Milestone 1, we hard coded these values:\n amount0 = 0.998976618347425280 ether;  amount1 = 5000 ether; And now we\u0026rsquo;re going to calculate them in Solidity using formulas from Milestone 1. Let\u0026rsquo;s recall those formulas:\n$$\\Delta x = \\frac{L(\\sqrt{p(i_u)} - \\sqrt{p(i_c)})}{\\sqrt{p(i_u)}\\sqrt{p(i_c)}}$$ $$\\Delta y = L(\\sqrt{p(i_c)} - \\sqrt{p(i_l)})$$\n$\\Delta x$ is the amount of token0, or token $x$. Let\u0026rsquo;s implement it in Solidity:\n// src/lib/Math.sol function calcAmount0Delta(  uint160 sqrtPriceAX96,  uint160 sqrtPriceBX96,  uint128 liquidity ) internal pure returns (uint256 amount0) {  if (sqrtPriceAX96 \u0026gt; sqrtPriceBX96)  (sqrtPriceAX96, sqrtPriceBX96) = (sqrtPriceBX96, sqrtPriceAX96);   require(sqrtPriceAX96 \u0026gt; 0);   amount0 = divRoundingUp(  mulDivRoundingUp(  (uint256(liquidity) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; FixedPoint96.RESOLUTION),  (sqrtPriceBX96 - sqrtPriceAX96),  sqrtPriceBX96  ),  sqrtPriceAX96  ); }  This function is identical to calc_amount0 in our Python script.\n First step is to sort the prices to ensure we don\u0026rsquo;t underflow when subtracting. Next, we convert liquidity to a Q96.64 number by multiplying it by 2**96. Next, according to the formula, we multiply it by the difference of the prices and divide it by the bigger price. Then, we divide by the smaller price. The order of division doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter, but we want to have two divisions because multiplication of prices can overflow.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re using mulDivRoundingUp to multiply and divide in one operation. This function is based on mulDiv from PRBMath:\nfunction mulDivRoundingUp(  uint256 a,  uint256 b,  uint256 denominator ) internal pure returns (uint256 result) {  result = PRBMath.mulDiv(a, b, denominator);  if (mulmod(a, b, denominator) \u0026gt; 0) {  require(result \u0026lt; type(uint256).max);  result++;  } } mulmod is a Solidity function that multiplies two numbers (a and b), divides the result by denominator, and returns the remainder. If the remainder is positive, we round the result up.\nNext, $\\Delta y$:\nfunction calcAmount1Delta(  uint160 sqrtPriceAX96,  uint160 sqrtPriceBX96,  uint128 liquidity ) internal pure returns (uint256 amount1) {  if (sqrtPriceAX96 \u0026gt; sqrtPriceBX96)  (sqrtPriceAX96, sqrtPriceBX96) = (sqrtPriceBX96, sqrtPriceAX96);   amount1 = mulDivRoundingUp(  liquidity,  (sqrtPriceBX96 - sqrtPriceAX96),  FixedPoint96.Q96  ); }  This function is identical to calc_amount1 in our Python script.\n Again, we\u0026rsquo;re using mulDivRoundingUp to avoid overflows during multiplication.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s it! We can now use the functions to calculate token amounts:\n// src/UniswapV3Pool.sol function mint(...) {  ...  Slot0 memory slot0_ = slot0;   amount0 = Math.calcAmount0Delta(  slot0_.sqrtPriceX96,  TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(upperTick),  amount  );   amount1 = Math.calcAmount1Delta(  slot0_.sqrtPriceX96,  TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(lowerTick),  amount  );  ... } Everything else remains the same. You\u0026rsquo;ll need to update the amounts in the pool tests, they\u0026rsquo;ll be slightly different due to rounding.\n"},{"id":29,"href":"/docs/milestone_3/liquidity-calculation/","title":"Liquidity Calculation","section":"Milestone 3.

Luckily, we already know all the formulas. Let\u0026rsquo;s recall this one:\n$$\\Delta x = \\Delta \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{P}}L$$\nIn a previous chapter, we used this formula to calculate swap amounts ($\\Delta x$ in this case) and now we\u0026rsquo;re going to use it to find $L$:\n$$L = \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{P}}}$$\nOr, after simplifying it: $$L = \\frac{\\Delta x \\sqrt{P_u} \\sqrt{P_l}}{\\sqrt{P_u} - \\sqrt{P_l}}$$\n We derived this formula in Liquidity Amount Calculation.\n In Solidity, we\u0026rsquo;ll again use PRBMath to handle overflows when multiplying and then dividing:\nfunction getLiquidityForAmount0(  uint160 sqrtPriceAX96,  uint160 sqrtPriceBX96,  uint256 amount0 ) internal pure returns (uint128 liquidity) {  if (sqrtPriceAX96 \u0026gt; sqrtPriceBX96)  (sqrtPriceAX96, sqrtPriceBX96) = (sqrtPriceBX96, sqrtPriceAX96);   uint256 intermediate = PRBMath.mulDiv(  sqrtPriceAX96,  sqrtPriceBX96,  FixedPoint96.Q96  );  liquidity = uint128(  PRBMath.mulDiv(amount0, intermediate, sqrtPriceBX96 - sqrtPriceAX96)  ); } Implementing Liquidity Calculation for Token Y #  Similarly, we\u0026rsquo;ll use the other formula from Liquidity Amount Calculation to find $L$ when amount of $y$ and price range is known: $$\\Delta y = \\Delta\\sqrt{P} L$$ $$L = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\sqrt{P_u}-\\sqrt{P_l}}$$\nfunction getLiquidityForAmount1(  uint160 sqrtPriceAX96,  uint160 sqrtPriceBX96,  uint256 amount1 ) internal pure returns (uint128 liquidity) {  if (sqrtPriceAX96 \u0026gt; sqrtPriceBX96)  (sqrtPriceAX96, sqrtPriceBX96) = (sqrtPriceBX96, sqrtPriceAX96);   liquidity = uint128(  PRBMath.mulDiv(  amount1,  FixedPoint96.Q96,  sqrtPriceBX96 - sqrtPriceAX96  )  ); } I hope this is clear!\nFinding Fair Liquidity #  You might be wondering why there are two ways of calculating $L$ while we have always had only one $L$, which is calculated as $L = \\sqrt{xy}$, and which of these ways is correct. The answer is: they\u0026rsquo;re both correct.\nIn the above formulas, we calculate $L$ based on different parameters: price range and the amount of either token. Different price ranges and different token amounts will result in different values of $L$. And there\u0026rsquo;s a scenario where we need to calculate both of the $L$\u0026rsquo;s and pick one of them. Recall this piece from mint function:\nif (slot0_.tick \u0026lt; lowerTick) {  amount0 = Math.calcAmount0Delta(...); } else if (slot0_.tick \u0026lt; upperTick) {  amount0 = Math.calcAmount0Delta(...);   amount1 = Math.calcAmount1Delta(...);   liquidity = LiquidityMath.addLiquidity(liquidity, int128(amount)); } else {  amount1 = Math.calcAmount1Delta(...); } It turns out, we also need to follow this logic when calculating liquidity:\n if we\u0026rsquo;re calculating liquidity for a range that\u0026rsquo;s below current price, we use the $\\Delta x$ version on the formula; when calculation liquidity for a range that\u0026rsquo;s above current price, we use the $\\Delta y$ one; when a price range includes the current price, we calculate both and pick the smaller of them.   Again, we discussed these ideas in Liquidity Amount Calculation.\n Let\u0026rsquo;s implement this logic now. When current price is below the lower bound of a price range:\nfunction getLiquidityForAmounts(  uint160 sqrtPriceX96,  uint160 sqrtPriceAX96,  uint160 sqrtPriceBX96,  uint256 amount0,  uint256 amount1 ) internal pure returns (uint128 liquidity) {  if (sqrtPriceAX96 \u0026gt; sqrtPriceBX96)  (sqrtPriceAX96, sqrtPriceBX96) = (sqrtPriceBX96, sqrtPriceAX96);   if (sqrtPriceX96 \u0026lt;= sqrtPriceAX96) {  liquidity = getLiquidityForAmount0(  sqrtPriceAX96,  sqrtPriceBX96,  amount0  ); When current price is within a range, we\u0026rsquo;re picking the smaller $L$:\n} else if (sqrtPriceX96 \u0026lt;= sqrtPriceBX96) {  uint128 liquidity0 = getLiquidityForAmount0(  sqrtPriceX96,  sqrtPriceBX96,  amount0  );  uint128 liquidity1 = getLiquidityForAmount1(  sqrtPriceAX96,  sqrtPriceX96,  amount1  );   liquidity = liquidity0 \u0026lt; liquidity1 ? liquidity0 : liquidity1; And finally:\n} else {  liquidity = getLiquidityForAmount1(  sqrtPriceAX96,  sqrtPriceBX96,  amount1  ); } Done.\n"},{"id":30,"href":"/docs/milestone_1/manager-contract/","title":"Manager Contract","section":"Milestone 1. First Swap","content":"Manager Contract #  Before deploying our pool contract, we need to solve one problem. As you remember, Uniswap V3 contracts are split into two categories:\n Core contracts that implement the core functions and don\u0026rsquo;t provide user-friendly interfaces. Periphery contracts that implement user-friendly interfaces for the core contracts.  The pool contract is a core contract, it\u0026rsquo;s not supposed to be user-friendly and flexible. It expects the caller to do all the calculations (prices, amounts) and to provide proper call parameters. It also doesn\u0026rsquo;t use ERC20\u0026rsquo;s transferFrom to transfer tokens from the caller. Instead, it uses two callbacks:\n uniswapV3MintCallback, which is called when minting liquidity; uniswapV3SwapCallback, which is called when swapping tokens.  In our tests, we implemented these callbacks in the test contract. Since it\u0026rsquo;s only a contract that can implement them, the pool contract cannot be called by regular users (non-contract addresses). This is fine. But not anymore 🙂.\nOur next steps in the book is deploying the pool contract to a local blockchain and interacting with it from a front-end app. Thus, we need to build a contract that will let non-contract addresses to interact with the pool. Let\u0026rsquo;s do this now!\nWorkflow #  This is how the manager contract will work:\n To mint liquidity, we\u0026rsquo;ll approve spending of tokens to the manager contract. We\u0026rsquo;ll then call mint function of the manager contract and pass it minting parameters, as well as the address of the pool we want to provide liquidity into. The manager contract will call the pool\u0026rsquo;s mint function and will implement uniswapV3MintCallback. It\u0026rsquo;ll have permissions to send our tokens to the pool contract. To swap tokens, we\u0026rsquo;ll also approve spending of tokens to the manager contract. We\u0026rsquo;ll then call swap function of the manager contract and, similarly to minting, it\u0026rsquo;ll pass the call to the pool. The manager contract will send our tokens to the pool contract, the pool contract will swap them, and will send the output amount to us.  Thus, the manager contract will act as a intermediary between users and pools.\nPassing Data to Callbacks #  Before implementing the manager contract, we need to upgrade the pool contract.\nThe manager contract will work with any pool and it\u0026rsquo;ll allow any address to call it. To achieve this, we need to upgrade the callbacks: we want to pass different pool addresses and user addresses to them. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at our current implementation of uniswapV3MintCallback (in the test contract):\nfunction uniswapV3MintCallback(uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) public {  if (transferInMintCallback) {  token0.transfer(msg.sender, amount0);  token1.transfer(msg.sender, amount1);  } } Key points here:\n The function transfers tokens belonging to the test contract–we want it to transfer tokens from the caller by using transferFrom. The function knows token0 and token1, which will be different for every pool.  Idea: we need to change the arguments of the callback so we could pass user and pool addresses.\nNow, let\u0026rsquo;s look at the swap callback:\nfunction uniswapV3SwapCallback(int256 amount0, int256 amount1) public {  if (amount0 \u0026gt; 0 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; transferInSwapCallback) {  token0.transfer(msg.sender, uint256(amount0));  }   if (amount1 \u0026gt; 0 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; transferInSwapCallback) {  token1.transfer(msg.sender, uint256(amount1));  } } Identically, it transfers tokens from the test contract and it knows token0 and token1.\nTo pass the extra data to the callbacks, we need to pass it to mint and swap first (since callbacks are called from these functions). However, since this extra data is not used in the functions and to not make their arguments messier, we\u0026rsquo;ll encode the extra data using abi.encode().\nLet\u0026rsquo;s define the extra data as a structure:\n// src/UniswapV3Pool.sol ... struct CallbackData {  address token0;  address token1;  address payer; } ... And then pass encoded data to the callbacks:\nfunction mint(  address owner,  int24 lowerTick,  int24 upperTick,  uint128 amount,  bytes calldata data // \u0026lt;--- New line ) external returns (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) {  ...

Even though it\u0026rsquo;s not essential to a DEX (there are DEXes that don\u0026rsquo;t implement a price oracle), it\u0026rsquo;s still an important feature of Uniswap and something that\u0026rsquo;s interesting to learn about.\nWhat is Price Oracle? #  Price oracle is a mechanism that provides asset prices to blockchain. Since blockchains are isolated ecosystems, there\u0026rsquo;s no direct way of querying external data, e.g. fetching asset prices from centralized exchanges via API. Another, a very hard one, problem is data validity and authenticity: when fetching prices from an exchange, how do you know they\u0026rsquo;re real? You have to trust the source. But the internet is not often secure and, sometimes, prices can be manipulated, DNS records can be hijacked, API servers can go down, etc. All these difficulties need to be addressed so we could have reliable and correct on-chain prices.\nOne of the first working solution of the above mentioned problems was Chainlink. Chainlink runs a decentralized network of oracles that fetch asset prices from centralized exchanges via APIs, average them, and provide them on-chain in a tamper-proof way. Basically, Chainlink is a set of contracts with one state variable, asset price, that can be read by anyone (any other contract or user) but can be written to only by oracles.\nThis is one way of looking at price oracles. There\u0026rsquo;s another.\nIf we have native on-chain exchanges, why would we need to fetch prices from outside? This is how the Uniswap price oracle works. Thanks to arbitraging and high liquidity, asset prices on Uniswap are close to those on centralized exchanges. So, instead of using centralized exchanges as the source of truth for asset prices, we can use Uniswap, and we don\u0026rsquo;t need to solve the problems related to delivering data on-chain (we also don\u0026rsquo;t need to trust to data providers).\nHow Uniswap Price Oracle Works #  Uniswap simply keeps the record of all previous swap prices. That\u0026rsquo;s it. But instead of tracking actual prices, Uniswap tracks the accumulated price, which is the sum of prices at each second in the history of a pool contract.\n$$a_{i} = \\sum_{i=1}^t p_{i}$$\nThis approach allows to find time-weighted average price between two points in time ($t_1$ and $t_2$) by simply getting the accumulated prices at these points ($a_{t_1}$ and $a_{t_2}$), subtracting one from the other, and dividing by the number of seconds between the two points:\n$$p_{t_1,t_2} = \\frac{a_{t_2} - a_{t_1}}{t_2 - t_1}$$\nThis is how it worked in Uniswap V2. In V3, it\u0026rsquo;s slightly different. The price that\u0026rsquo;s accumulated is the current tick (which is $log_{1.0001}$ of the price):\n$$a_{i} = \\sum_{i=1}^t log_{1.0001}P(i)$$\nAnd instead of averaging prices, geometric mean is taken:\n$$ P_{t_1,t_2} = \\left( \\prod_{i=t_1}^{t_2} P_i \\right) ^ \\frac{1}{t_2-t_1} $$\nTo find the time-weighted geometric mean price between two points in time, we take the accumulated values at these time points, subtract one from the other, divide by the number of seconds between the two points, and calculate $1.0001^{x}$:\n$$ log_{1.0001}{(P_{t_1,t_2})} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=t_1}^{t_2} log_{1.0001}(P_i)}{t_2-t_1}$$ $$ = \\frac{a_{t_2} - a_{t_1}}{t_2-t_1}$$\n$$P_{t_1,t_2} = 1.0001^{\\frac{a_{t_2} - a_{t_1}}{t_2-t_1}}$$\nUniswap V2 didn\u0026rsquo;t store historical accumulated prices, which required referring to a third-party blockchain data indexing service to find a historical price when calculating an average one. Uniswap V3, on the other hand, allows to store up to 65,535 historical accumulated prices, which makes it much easier to calculate any historical time-weighter geometric price.\nPrice Manipulation Mitigation #  Another important topic is price manipulation and how it\u0026rsquo;s mitigated in Uniswap.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s theoretically possible to manipulate a pool\u0026rsquo;s price to your advantage: for example, buy a big amount of tokens to raise its price and get a profit on a third-party DeFi service that uses Uniswap price oracles, then trade the tokens back to the real price. To mitigate such attacks, Uniswap tracks prices at the end of a block, after the last trade of a block. This removes the possibility of in-block price manipulations.\nTechnically, prices in the Uniswap oracle are updated at the beginning of each block, and each price is calculated before the first swap in a block.\nPrice Oracle Implementation #  Alright, let\u0026rsquo;s get to code.\nObservations and Cardinality #  We\u0026rsquo;ll begin by creating the Oracle library contract and the Observation structure:\n// src/lib/Oracle.sol library Oracle {  struct Observation {  uint32 timestamp;  int56 tickCumulative;  bool initialized;  }  ... } An observation is a slot that stores a recorded price. It stores a price, the timestamp when this price was recorded, and the initialized flag that is set to true when the observation is activated (not all observations are activated by default). A pool contract can store up to 65,535 observations:\n// src/UniswapV3Pool.sol contract UniswapV3Pool is IUniswapV3Pool {  using Oracle for Oracle.Observation[65535];  ...  Oracle.Observation[65535] public observations; } However, since storing that many instances of Observation requires a lot of gas (someone would have to pay for writing each of them to contract\u0026rsquo;s storage), a pool by default can store only 1 observation, which gets overwritten each time a new price is recorded. The number of activated observations, the cardinality of observations, can be increased at any time by anyone who\u0026rsquo;s willing to pay for that. To manage cardinality, we need a few extra state variables:\n ...  struct Slot0 {  // Current sqrt(P)  uint160 sqrtPriceX96;  // Current tick  int24 tick;  // Most recent observation index  uint16 observationIndex;  // Maximum number of observations  uint16 observationCardinality;  // Next maximum number of observations  uint16 observationCardinalityNext;  }  ...  observationIndex tracks the index of the most recent observation; observationCardinality tracks the number of activated observations; observationCardinalityNext track the next cardinality the array of observations can expand to.  Observations are stored in a fixed-length array that expands when a new observation is saved and observationCardinalityNext is greater than observationCardinality (which signals that cardinality can be expanded). If the array cannot be expanded (next cardinality value equals to the current one), oldest observations get overwritten, i.e. observation is stored at index 0, next one is stored at index 1, and so on.\nWhen pool is created, observationCardinality and observationCardinalityNext are set to 1:\n// src/UniswapV3Pool.sol contract UniswapV3Pool is IUniswapV3Pool {  function initialize(uint160 sqrtPriceX96) public {  ...   (uint16 cardinality, uint16 cardinalityNext) = observations.initialize(  _blockTimestamp()  );   slot0 = Slot0({  sqrtPriceX96: sqrtPriceX96,  tick: tick,  observationIndex: 0,  observationCardinality: cardinality,  observationCardinalityNext: cardinalityNext  });  } } // src/lib/Oracle.sol library Oracle {  ...  function initialize(Observation[65535] storage self, uint32 time)  internal  returns (uint16 cardinality, uint16 cardinalityNext)  {  self[0] = Observation({  timestamp: time,  tickCumulative: 0,  initialized: true  });   cardinality = 1;  cardinalityNext = 1;  }  ... } Writing Observations #  In swap function, when current price is changed, an observation is written to the observations array:\n// src/UniswapV3Pool.sol contract UniswapV3Pool is IUniswapV3Pool {  function swap(...) public returns (...) {  ...  if (state.tick != slot0_.tick) {  (  uint16 observationIndex,  uint16 observationCardinality  ) = observations.write(  slot0_.observationIndex,  _blockTimestamp(),  slot0_.tick,  slot0_.observationCardinality,  slot0_.observationCardinalityNext  );   (  slot0.sqrtPriceX96,  slot0.tick,  slot0.observationIndex,  slot0.observationCardinality  ) = (  state.sqrtPriceX96,  state.tick,  observationIndex,  observationCardinality  );  }  ...  } } Notice that the tick that\u0026rsquo;s observed here is slot0_.tick (not state.stick), i.e. the price before the swap! It\u0026rsquo;s updated with a new price in the next statement. This is the price manipulation mitigation we discussed earlier: Uniswap tracks prices before the first trade in the block and after the last trade in the previous block.\nAlso notice that each observation is identified by _blockTimestamp(), i.e. the current block timestamp. This means that if there\u0026rsquo;s already an observation for the current block, a price is not recorded. If there are no observations for the current block (i.e. this is the first swap in the block), a price is recorded. This is part of the price manipulation mitigation mechanism.\n// src/lib/Oracle.sol function write(  Observation[65535] storage self,  uint16 index,  uint32 timestamp,  int24 tick,  uint16 cardinality,  uint16 cardinalityNext ) internal returns (uint16 indexUpdated, uint16 cardinalityUpdated) {  Observation memory last = self[index];   if (last.timestamp == timestamp) return (index, cardinality);   if (cardinalityNext \u0026gt; cardinality \u0026amp;\u0026amp; index == (cardinality - 1)) {  cardinalityUpdated = cardinalityNext;  } else {  cardinalityUpdated = cardinality;  }   indexUpdated = (index + 1) % cardinalityUpdated;  self[indexUpdated] = transform(last, timestamp, tick); } Here we see that an observation is skipped when there\u0026rsquo;s already an observation made at the current block. If there\u0026rsquo;s no such observation though, we\u0026rsquo;re saving a new one and trying to expand the cardinality when possible. The modulo operator (%) ensures that observation index stays within the range $[0, cardinality)$ and resets to 0 when the upper bound is reached.\nNow, let\u0026rsquo;s look at the transform function:\nfunction transform(  Observation memory last,  uint32 timestamp,  int24 tick ) internal pure returns (Observation memory) {  uint56 delta = timestamp - last.timestamp;   return  Observation({  timestamp: timestamp,  tickCumulative: last.tickCumulative +  int56(tick) *  int56(delta),  initialized: true  }); } What we\u0026rsquo;re calculating here is the accumulated price: current tick gets multiplied by the number of the seconds since the last observation and gets added to the last accumulated price.\nIncrease of Cardinality #  Let\u0026rsquo;s now see how cardinality is expanded.\nAnyone at any time can increase the cardinality of observations of a pool and pay for the gas required to do so. For this, we\u0026rsquo;ll add a new public function to Pool contract:\n// src/UniswapV3Pool.sol function increaseObservationCardinalityNext(  uint16 observationCardinalityNext ) public {  uint16 observationCardinalityNextOld = slot0.observationCardinalityNext;  uint16 observationCardinalityNextNew = observations.grow(  observationCardinalityNextOld,  observationCardinalityNext  );   if (observationCardinalityNextNew != observationCardinalityNextOld) {  slot0.observationCardinalityNext = observationCardinalityNextNew;  emit IncreaseObservationCardinalityNext(  observationCardinalityNextOld,  observationCardinalityNextNew  );  } } And a new function to Oracle:\n// src/lib/Oracle.sol function grow(  Observation[65535] storage self,  uint16 current,  uint16 next ) internal returns (uint16) {  if (next \u0026lt;= current) return current;   for (uint16 i = current; i \u0026lt; next; i++) {  self[i].timestamp = 1;  }   return next; } In the grow function, we\u0026rsquo;re allocating new observations by setting the timestamp field of each of them to some non- zero value. Notice that self is a storage variable, assigning values to its elements will update the array counter and write the values to contract\u0026rsquo;s storage.\nReading Observations #  We\u0026rsquo;ve finally come to the trickiest part of this chapter: reading of observations. Before moving on, let\u0026rsquo;s review how observations are stored to get a better picture.\nObservations are stored in a fixed-length array that can be expanded:\nAs we noted above, observations are expected to overflow: if a new observation doesn\u0026rsquo;t fit into the array, writing continues starting at index 0, i.e. oldest observations get overwritten:\nThere\u0026rsquo;s no guarantee that an observation will be stored for every block because swaps don\u0026rsquo;t happen in every block. Thus, there will be blocks we don\u0026rsquo;t know prices at, and such periods of missing observations can be long. Of course, we don\u0026rsquo;t want to have gaps in the prices reported by the oracle, and this is why we\u0026rsquo;re using time-weighted average prices (TWAP)–so we could have averaged prices in the periods where there were no observations. TWAP allows us to interpolate prices, i.e. to draw a line between two observations–each point on the line will be a price at a specific timestamp between the two observations.\nSo, reading observations means finding observations by timestamps and interpolating missing observations, taking into consideration that the observations array is allowed to overflow (e.g. the oldest observation can come after the most recent one in the array). Since we\u0026rsquo;re not indexing the observations by timestamps (to save gas), we\u0026rsquo;ll need to use the binary search algorithm to efficient search. But not always.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s break it down into smaller steps and begin by implementing observe function in Oracle:\nfunction observe(  Observation[65535] storage self,  uint32 time,  uint32[] memory secondsAgos,  int24 tick,  uint16 index,  uint16 cardinality ) internal view returns (int56[] memory tickCumulatives) {  tickCumulatives = new int56[](secondsAgos.length);   for (uint256 i = 0; i \u0026lt; secondsAgos.length; i++) {  tickCumulatives[i] = observeSingle(  self,  time,  secondsAgos[i],  tick,  index,  cardinality  );  } } The function takes current block timestamp, the list of time points we want to get prices at (secondsAgo), current tick, observations index, and cardinality.\nMoving to the observeSingle function:\nfunction observeSingle(  Observation[65535] storage self,  uint32 time,  uint32 secondsAgo,  int24 tick,  uint16 index,  uint16 cardinality ) internal view returns (int56 tickCumulative) {  if (secondsAgo == 0) {  Observation memory last = self[index];  if (last.timestamp != time) last = transform(last, time, tick);  return last.tickCumulative;  }  ... } When most recent observation is requested (0 seconds passed), we can return it right away. If it wasn\u0026rsquo;t record in the current block, transform it to consider the current block and the current tick.\nIf an older time point is requested, we need to make several checks before switching to the binary search algorithm:\n if the requested time point is the last observation, we can return the accumulated price at the latest observation; if the requested time point is after the last observation, we can call transform to find the accumulated price at this point, knowing the last observed price and the current price; if the requested time point is before the last observation, we have to use the binary search.  Let\u0026rsquo;s go straight to the third point:\nfunction binarySearch(  Observation[65535] storage self,  uint32 time,  uint32 target,  uint16 index,  uint16 cardinality )  private  view  returns (Observation memory beforeOrAt, Observation memory atOrAfter) {  ... The function takes the current block timestamp (time), the timestamp of the price point requested (target), as well as the current observations index and cardinality. It returns the range between two observations in which the requested time point is located.\nTo initialize the binary search algorithm, we set the boundaries:\nuint256 l = (index + 1) % cardinality; // oldest observation uint256 r = l + cardinality - 1; // newest observation uint256 i; Recall that the observations array is expected to overflow, that\u0026rsquo;s why we\u0026rsquo;re using the modulo operator here.\nThen we spin up an infinite loop, in which we check the middle point of the range: if it\u0026rsquo;s not initialized (there\u0026rsquo;s no observation), we\u0026rsquo;re continuing with the next point:\nwhile (true) {  i = (l + r) / 2;   beforeOrAt = self[i % cardinality];   if (!beforeOrAt.initialized) {  l = i + 1;  continue;  }   ... If the point is initialized, we call it the left boundary of the range we want the requested time point to be included in. And we\u0026rsquo;re trying to find the right boundary (atOrAfter):\n ...  atOrAfter = self[(i + 1) % cardinality];   bool targetAtOrAfter = lte(time, beforeOrAt.timestamp, target);   if (targetAtOrAfter \u0026amp;\u0026amp; lte(time, target, atOrAfter.timestamp))  break;  ... If we\u0026rsquo;ve found the boundaries, we return them. If not, we continue our search:\n ...  if (!targetAtOrAfter) r = i - 1;  else l = i + 1; } After finding a range of observations the requested time point belongs to, we need to calculate the price at the requested time point:\n// function observeSingle() {  ...  uint56 observationTimeDelta = atOrAfter.timestamp -  beforeOrAt.timestamp;  uint56 targetDelta = target - beforeOrAt.timestamp;  return  beforeOrAt.tickCumulative +  ((atOrAfter.tickCumulative - beforeOrAt.tickCumulative) /  int56(observationTimeDelta)) *  int56(targetDelta);  ... This is as simple as finding the average rate of change within the range and multiplying it by the number of seconds that has passed between the lower bound of the range and the time point we need. This is the interpolation we discussed earlier.\nThe last thing we need to implement here is a public function in Pool contract that reads and returns observations:\n// src/UniswapV3Pool.sol function observe(uint32[] calldata secondsAgos)  public  view  returns (int56[] memory tickCumulatives) {  return  observations.observe(  _blockTimestamp(),  secondsAgos,  slot0.tick,  slot0.observationIndex,  slot0.observationCardinality  ); } Interpreting Observations #  Let\u0026rsquo;s now see how to interpret observations.\nThe observe function we just added returns an array of accumulated prices, and we want to know how to convert them to actual prices. I\u0026rsquo;ll demonstrate this in a test of the observe function.\nIn the test, I run multiple swaps in different directions and at different blocks:\nfunction testObserve() public {  ...  pool.increaseObservationCardinalityNext(3);   vm.warp(2);  pool.swap(address(this), false, swapAmount, sqrtP(6000), extra);   vm.warp(7);  pool.swap(address(this), true, swapAmount2, sqrtP(4000), extra);   vm.warp(20);  pool.swap(address(this), false, swapAmount, sqrtP(6000), extra);  ...  vm.warp is a cheat-code provided by Foundry: it forwards to a block with the specified timestamp. 2, 7, 20 – these are block timestamps.\n The first swap is made at the block with timestamp 2, the second one is made at timestamp 7, and the third one is made at timestamp 20. We can then read the observations:\n ...  secondsAgos = new uint32[](4);  secondsAgos[0] = 0;  secondsAgos[1] = 13;  secondsAgos[2] = 17;  secondsAgos[3] = 18;   int56[] memory tickCumulatives = pool.observe(secondsAgos);  assertEq(tickCumulatives[0], 1607059);  assertEq(tickCumulatives[1], 511146);  assertEq(tickCumulatives[2], 170370);  assertEq(tickCumulatives[3], 85176);  ...  The earliest observed price is 0, which is the initial observation that\u0026rsquo;s set when the pool is deployed. However, since the cardinality was set to 3 and we made 3 swaps, it was overwritten by the last observation. During the first swap, tick 85176 was observed, which is the initial price of the pool–recall that the price before a swap is observed. Because the very first observation was overwritten, this is the oldest observation now. Next returned accumulated price is 170370, which is 85176 + 85194. The former is the previous accumulator value, the latter is the price after the first swap that was observed during the second swap. Next returned accumulated price is 511146, which is (511146 - 170370) / (17 - 13) = 85194, the accumulated price between the second and the third swap. Finally, the most recent observation is 1607059, which is (1607059 - 511146) / (20 - 7) = 84301, which is ~4581 USDC/ETH, the price after the second swap that was observed during the third swap.  And here\u0026rsquo;s an example that involves interpolation: the time points requested are not the time points of the swaps:\nsecondsAgos = new uint32[](5); secondsAgos[0] = 0; secondsAgos[1] = 5; secondsAgos[2] = 10; secondsAgos[3] = 15; secondsAgos[4] = 18;  tickCumulatives = pool.observe(secondsAgos); assertEq(tickCumulatives[0], 1607059); assertEq(tickCumulatives[1], 1185554); assertEq(tickCumulatives[2], 764049); assertEq(tickCumulatives[3], 340758); assertEq(tickCumulatives[4], 85176); This results in prices: 4581.03, 4581.03, 4747.6, 5008.91, which are the average prices within the requested intervals.\n Here\u0026rsquo;s how to compute those values in Python:\nvals = [1607059, 1185554, 764049, 340758, 85176] secs = [0, 5, 10, 15, 18] [1.0001**((vals[i] - vals[i+1]) / (secs[i+1] - secs[i])) for i in range(len(vals)-1)]  "},{"id":32,"href":"/docs/milestone_4/user-interface/","title":"User Interface","section":"Milestone 4. Multi-pool Swaps","content":"User Interface #  After introducing swap paths, we can significantly simplify the internals of our web app. First of all, every swap now uses a path since path doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to contain multiple pools. Second, it\u0026rsquo;s now easier to change the direction of swap: we can simply reverse the path. And, thanks to the unified pool address generation via CREATE2 and unique salts, we no longer need to store pool addresses and care about tokens order.\nHowever, we cannot integrate multi-pool swaps in the web app without adding one crucial algorithm. Ask yourself the question: \u0026ldquo;How to find a path between two tokens that don\u0026rsquo;t have a pool?\u0026rdquo;\nAutoRouter #  Uniswap implements what\u0026rsquo;s called AutoRouter, an algorithm that find shortest path between two tokens. Moreover, it also splits one payment into multiple smaller payments to find the best average exchange rate. The profit can be as big as 36.84% compared to trades that are not split. This sounds great, however, we\u0026rsquo;re not going to build such an advanced algorithm. Instead, we\u0026rsquo;ll build something simpler.\nA Simple Router Design #  Suppose we have a whole bunch of pools:\nHow do we find a shortest path between two tokens in such a mess?\nThe most suitable solution for such kind of tasks is based on a graph. A graph is a data structure that consists of nodes (objects representing something) and edges (links connecting nodes). We can turn that mess of pools into a graph where each node is a token (that has a pool) and each edge is a pool this token belongs to. So a pool represented as a graph is two nodes connected with an edge. And the above pools become this graph:\nThe biggest advantage graphs give us is the ability to traverse its nods, from one node to another, to find paths. Specifically, we\u0026rsquo;ll use A* search algorithm. Feel free learning about how the algorithm works, but, in our app, we\u0026rsquo;ll use a library to make our life easier. The set of libraries we\u0026rsquo;ll use is: ngraph.ngraph for building graphs and ngraph.path for finding paths (it\u0026rsquo;s the latter that implements A* search algorithm, as well as some others).\nIn the UI app, let\u0026rsquo;s create a path finder. This will be a class that, when instantiated, turns a list of pairs into a graph to later use the graph to find a shortest path between two tokens.\nimport createGraph from \u0026#39;ngraph.graph\u0026#39;; import path from \u0026#39;ngraph.path\u0026#39;;  class PathFinder {  constructor(pairs) {  this.graph = createGraph();   pairs.forEach((pair) =\u0026gt; {  this.graph.addNode(pair.token0.address);  this.graph.addNode(pair.token1.address);  this.graph.addLink(pair.token0.address, pair.token1.address, pair.tickSpacing);  this.graph.addLink(pair.token1.address, pair.token0.address, pair.tickSpacing);  });   this.finder = path.aStar(this.graph);  }   ... In the constructor, we\u0026rsquo;re creating an empty graph and fill it with linked nodes. Each node is a token address and links have associated data, which is tick spacings–we\u0026rsquo;ll be able to extract this information from paths found by A*. After initializing a graph, we instantiate A* algorithm implementation.\nNext, we need to implement a function that will find a path between tokens and turn it into an array of token addresses and tick spacings:\nfindPath(fromToken, toToken) {  return this.finder.find(fromToken, toToken).reduce((acc, node, i, orig) =\u0026gt; {  if (acc.length \u0026gt; 0) {  acc.push(this.graph.getLink(orig[i - 1].id, node.id).data);  }   acc.push(node.id);   return acc;  }, []).reverse(); } this.finder.find(fromToken, toToken) returns a list of nodes and, unfortunately, doesn\u0026rsquo;t contain the information about edges between them (we store tick spacings in edges). Thus, we\u0026rsquo;re calling this.graph.getLink(previousNode, currentNode) to find edges.\nNow, whenever user changes input or output token, we can call pathFinder.findPath(token0, token1) to build a new path.\n"},{"id":33,"href":"/docs/milestone_3/more-on-fixed-point-numbers/","title":"A Little Bit More on Fixed-point Numbers","section":"Milestone 3.

We don\u0026rsquo;t need to do this in the main contracts, but it\u0026rsquo;s helpful to have such function in tests so we don\u0026rsquo;t hardcode ticks and could write something like tick(5000)–this makes code easier to read because it\u0026rsquo;s more convenient for us to think in prices, not tick indexes.\nRecall that, to find ticks, we use TickMath.getTickAtSqrtRatio function, which takes $\\sqrt{P}$ as its argument, and the $\\sqrt{P}$ is a Q64.96 fixed-point number. In smart contract tests, we need to check $\\sqrt{P}$ many times in many different test cases: mostly after mints and swaps. Instead of hard coding actual values, it might be cleaner to use a helper function like sqrtP(5000) that converts prices to $\\sqrt{P}$.\nSo, what\u0026rsquo;s the problem?\nThe problem is that Solidity doesn\u0026rsquo;t natively support the square root operation, which means we need a third-party library. Another problem is that prices are often relatively small numbers, like 10, 5000, 0.01, etc., and we don\u0026rsquo;t want to lose precision when taking square root.\nYou probably remember that we used PRBMath earlier in the book to implement multiply-then-divide operation that doesn\u0026rsquo;t overflow during multiplication. If you check PRBMath.sol contract, you\u0026rsquo;ll notice sqrt function. However, the function doesn\u0026rsquo;t support fixed-point numbers, as the function description says. You can give it a try and see that PRBMath.sqrt(5000) results in 70, which is an integer number with lost precision (without the fractional part).\nIf you check prb-math repo, you\u0026rsquo;ll see these contracts: PRBMathSD59x18.sol and PRBMathUD60x18.sol. Aha! These are fixed-point number implementations. Let\u0026rsquo;s pick the latter and see how it goes: PRBMathUD60x18.sqrt(5000 * PRBMathUD60x18.SCALE) returns 70710678118654752440. This looks interesting! PRBMathUD60x18 is a library that implements fixed-numbers with 18 decimal places in the fractional part. So the number we got is actually 70.710678118654752440 (use cast --from-wei 70710678118654752440).\nHowever, we cannot use this number!\nThere are fixed-point numbers and fixed-point numbers. The Q64.96 fixed-point number used by Uniswap V3 is a binary number–64 and 96 signify binary places. But PRBMathUD60x18 implements a decimal fixed-point number (UD in the contract name means \u0026ldquo;unsigned, decimal\u0026rdquo;), where 60 and 18 signify decimal places. This difference is quite significant.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s see how to convert an arbitrary number (42) to either of the above fixed-point numbers:\n Q64.96: $42 * 2^{96}$ or, using bitwise left shift, 2 \u0026lt;\u0026lt; 96. The result is 3327582825599102178928845914112. UD60.18: $42 * 10^{18}$. The result is 42000000000000000000.  Let\u0026rsquo;s now see how to convert numbers with the fractional part (42.1337):\n Q64.96: $421337 * 2^{92}$ or 421337 \u0026lt;\u0026lt; 92. The result is 2086359769329537075540689212669952. UD60.18: $421337 * 10^{14}$. The result is 42133700000000000000.  The second variant makes more sense to us because it uses the decimal system, which we learned in our childhood. The first variant uses the binary system and it\u0026rsquo;s much harder for us to read.\nBut the biggest problem with different variants is that it\u0026rsquo;s hard to convert between them.\nThis all means that we need a different library, one that implements a binary fixed-point number and sqrt function for it. Luckily, there\u0026rsquo;s such library: abdk-libraries-solidity. The library implemented Q64.64, not exactly what we need (not 96 bits in the fractional part) but this is not a problem.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how we can implement the price-to-tick function using the new library:\nfunction tick(uint256 price) internal pure returns (int24 tick_) {  tick_ = TickMath.getTickAtSqrtRatio(  uint160(  int160(  ABDKMath64x64.sqrt(int128(int256(price \u0026lt;\u0026lt; 64))) \u0026lt;\u0026lt;  (FixedPoint96.RESOLUTION - 64)  )  )  ); } ABDKMath64x64.sqrt takes Q64.64 numbers so we need to convert price to such number. The price is expected to not have the fractional part, so we\u0026rsquo;re shifting it by 64 bits. The sqrt function also returns a Q64.64 number but TickMath.getTickAtSqrtRatio takes a Q64.96 number–this is why we need to shift the result of the square root operation by 96 - 64 bits to the left.\n"},{"id":34,"href":"/docs/milestone_1/deployment/","title":"Deployment","section":"Milestone 1.

Now, let\u0026rsquo;s see how we can deploy it to a local Ethereum network so we could use it from a front-end app later on.\nChoosing Local Blockchain Network #  Smart contracts development requires running a local network, where you deploy your contracts during development and testing. This is what we want from such a network:\n Real blockchain. It must be a real Ethereum network, not an emulation. We want to be sure that our contract will work in the local network exactly as it would in the mainnet. Speed. We want our transactions to be minted immediately, so we could iterate quickly. Ether. To pay transaction fees, we need some ether, and we want the local network to allow us to generate any amount of ether. Cheat codes. Besides providing the standard API, we want a local network to allow us to do more. For example, we want to be able to deploy contracts at any address, execute transactions from any address (impersonate other address), change contract state directly, etc.  There are multiple solutions as of today:\n Ganache from Truffle Suite. Hardhat, which is a development environment that includes a local node besides other useful things. Anvil from Foundry.  All of these are viable solutions and each of them will satisfy our needs. Having said that, projects have been slowly migrating from Ganache (which is the oldest of the solutions) to Hardhat (which seems to be the most widely used these days), and now there\u0026rsquo;s the new kid on the block: Foundry. Foundry is also the only of these solutions that uses Solidity for writing tests (the others use JavaScript). Moreover, Foundry also allows to write deployment scripts in Solidity. Thus, since we\u0026rsquo;ve decided to use Solidity everywhere, we\u0026rsquo;ll use Anvil to run a local development blockchain, and we\u0026rsquo;ll write deployment scripts in Solidity.\nRunning Local Blockchain #  Anvil doesn\u0026rsquo;t require configuration, we can run it with a single command and it\u0026rsquo;ll do:\n$ anvil  _ _  (_) | |  __ _ _ __ __ __ _ | |  / _` | | \u0026#39;_ \\  \\ \\ / / | | | |  | (_| | | | | | \\ V / | | | |  \\__,_| |_| |_| \\_/ |_| |_|   0.1.0 (d89f6af 2022-06-24T00:15:17.897682Z)  https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry ... Listening on 127.0.0.1:8545 Anvil runs a single Ethereum node, so this is not really a network, but that\u0026rsquo;s ok. By default, it creates 10 accounts with 10,000 ETH in each of them. It prints the addresses and related private keys when it starts–we\u0026rsquo;ll be using one of these addresses when deploying and interacting with the contract from UI.\nAnvil exposes JSON-RPC API interface at 127.0.0.1:8545–this interface is the main way of interacting with Ethereum nodes. You can find full API reference here. And this is how you can call it via curl:\n$ curl -X POST -H \u0026#39;Content-Type: application/json\u0026#39; \\  --data \u0026#39;{\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;:1,\u0026#34;jsonrpc\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;2.0\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;method\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;eth_chainId\u0026#34;}\u0026#39; \\  http://127.0.0.1:8545 {\u0026#34;jsonrpc\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;2.0\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;:1,\u0026#34;result\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0x7a69\u0026#34;} $ curl -X POST -H \u0026#39;Content-Type: application/json\u0026#39; \\  --data \u0026#39;{\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;:1,\u0026#34;jsonrpc\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;2.0\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;method\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;eth_getBalance\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;params\u0026#34;:[\u0026#34;0xf39fd6e51aad88f6f4ce6ab8827279cfffb92266\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;latest\u0026#34;]}\u0026#39; \\  http://127.0.0.1:8545 {\u0026#34;jsonrpc\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;2.0\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;:1,\u0026#34;result\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0x21e19e0c9bab2400000\u0026#34;} You can also use cast (part of Foundry) for that:\n$ cast chain-id 31337 $ cast balance 0xf39fd6e51aad88f6f4ce6ab8827279cfffb92266 10000000000000000000000 Now, let\u0026rsquo;s deploy the pool and manager contracts to the local network.\nFirst Deployment #  At its core, deploying a contract means:\n Compiling source code into EVM bytecode. Sending a transaction with the bytecode. Creating a new address, executing the constructor part of the bytecode, storing initialized bytecode on the address. This step is done automatically by an Ethereum node, when your contract creation transaction is mined.  Deployment usually consists of multiple steps: preparing parameters, deploying auxiliary contracts, deploying main contracts, initializing contracts, etc. Scripting helps to automate these steps, and we\u0026rsquo;ll write scripts in Solidity!\nCreate scripts/DeployDevelopment.sol contract with this content:\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED pragma solidity ^0.8.14;  import \u0026#34;forge-std/Script.sol\u0026#34;;  contract DeployDevelopment is Script {  function run() public {  ...  } } It looks very similar to the test contract, with only difference is that it inherits from Script contract, not from Test. And, by convention, we need to define run function which will be the body of our deployment script. In the run function, we define the parameters of the deployment first:\nuint256 wethBalance = 1 ether; uint256 usdcBalance = 5042 ether; int24 currentTick = 85176; uint160 currentSqrtP = 5602277097478614198912276234240; These are the same values we used before. Notice that we\u0026rsquo;re about to mint 5042 USDC–that\u0026rsquo;s 5000 USDC we\u0026rsquo;ll provide as liquidity into the pool and 42 USDC we\u0026rsquo;ll sell in a swap.\nNext, we define the set of steps that will be executed as the deployment transaction (well, each of the steps will be a separate transaction). For this, we\u0026rsquo;re using startBroadcast/endBroadcast cheat codes:\nvm.startBroadcast(); ... vm.stopBroadcast();  These cheat codes are provided by of Foundry. We got them in the script contract by inheriting from forge-std/Script.sol.\n Everything that goes after the broadcast() cheat code or between startBroadcast()/stopBroadcast() is converted to transactions and these transactions are sent to the node that executes the script.\nBetween the broadcast cheat codes, we\u0026rsquo;ll put the actual deployment steps. First, we need to deploy the tokens:\nERC20Mintable token0 = new ERC20Mintable(\u0026#34;Wrapped Ether\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;WETH\u0026#34;, 18); ERC20Mintable token1 = new ERC20Mintable(\u0026#34;USD Coin\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;USDC\u0026#34;, 18); We cannot deploy the pool without having tokens, so we need to deploy them first.\n Since we\u0026rsquo;re deploying to a local development network, we need to deploy the tokens ourselves. In the mainnet and public test networks (Ropsten, Goerli, Sepolia), the tokens are already created. Thus, to deploy to those networks, we\u0026rsquo;ll need to write network-specific deployment scripts.\n The next step is to deploy the pool contract:\nUniswapV3Pool pool = new UniswapV3Pool(  address(token0),  address(token1),  currentSqrtP,  currentTick ); Next goes Manager contract deployment:\nUniswapV3Manager manager = new UniswapV3Manager(); And finally, we can mint some amount of ETH and USDC to our address:\ntoken0.mint(msg.sender, wethBalance); token1.mint(msg.sender, usdcBalance);  msg.sender in Foundry scripts is the address that sends transactions within the broadcast block. We\u0026rsquo;ll be able to set it when running scripts.\n Finally, at the end of the script, add some console.log calls to print the addresses of deployed contracts:\nconsole.log(\u0026#34;WETH address\u0026#34;, address(token0)); console.log(\u0026#34;USDC address\u0026#34;, address(token1)); console.log(\u0026#34;Pool address\u0026#34;, address(pool)); console.log(\u0026#34;Manager address\u0026#34;, address(manager)); Alright, let\u0026rsquo;s run the script (ensure Anvil is running in another terminal window):\n$ forge script scripts/DeployDevelopment.s.sol --broadcast --fork-url http://localhost:8545 --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast enables broadcasting of transactions. It\u0026rsquo;s not enabled by default because not every script sends transactions. --fork-url sets the address of the node to send transactions to. --private-key sets the sender wallet: a private key is needed to sign transactions. You can pick any of the private keys printed by Anvil when it\u0026rsquo;s starting. I took the first one:\n 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80\n Deployment takes several seconds. In the end, you\u0026rsquo;ll see a list of transactions it sent. It\u0026rsquo;ll also save transactions receipts to broadcast folder. In Anvil, you\u0026rsquo;ll also see many lines with eth_sendRawTransaction, eth_getTransactionByHash, and eth_getTransactionReceipt–after sending transactions to Anvil, Forge uses the JSON-RPC API to check their status and get transaction execution results (receipts).\nCongratulations! You\u0026rsquo;ve just deployed a smart contract!\nInteracting With Contracts, ABI #  Now, let\u0026rsquo;s see how we can interact with the deployed contracts.\nEvery contract exposes a set of public functions. In the case of the pool contract, these are mint(...) and swap(...). Additionally, Solidity creates getters for public variables, so we can also call token0(), token1(), positions(), etc. However, since contracts are compiled bytecodes, function names are lost during compilation and not stored on blockchain. Instead, every function is identified by a selector, which is the first 4 bytes of the hash of the signature of the function. In pseudocode:\nhash(\u0026#34;transfer(address,address,uint256)\u0026#34;)[0:4]  EVM uses the Keccak hashing algorithm, which was standardized as SHA-3. Specifically, the hashing function in Solidity is keccak256.\n Knowing this, let\u0026rsquo;s make two calls to the deployed contracts: one will be a low-level call via curl, and one will be made using cast.\nToken Balance #  Let\u0026rsquo;s check the WETH balance of the deployer address. The signature of the function is balanceOf(address) (as defined in ERC-20). To find the ID of this function (its selector), we\u0026rsquo;ll hash it and take the first four bytes:\n$ cast keccak \u0026#34;balanceOf(address)\u0026#34;| cut -b 1-10 0x70a08231 To pass the address, we simply append it to the function selector (and add left padding up to 32 digits since addresses take 32 bytes in function call data):\n 0x70a08231000000000000000000000000f39fd6e51aad88f6f4ce6ab8827279cfffb92266\n 0xf39fd6e51aad88f6f4ce6ab8827279cfffb92266 is the address we\u0026rsquo;re going to check balance of. This is our address, the first account in Anvil.\nNext, we execute eth_call JSON-RPC method to make the call. Notice that this doesn\u0026rsquo;t require sending a transaction–this endpoint is used to read data from contracts.\n$ params=\u0026#39;{\u0026#34;from\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0xf39fd6e51aad88f6f4ce6ab8827279cfffb92266\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;to\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0xe7f1725e7734ce288f8367e1bb143e90bb3f0512\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;data\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0x70a08231000000000000000000000000f39fd6e51aad88f6f4ce6ab8827279cfffb92266\u0026#34;}\u0026#39; $ curl -X POST -H \u0026#39;Content-Type: application/json\u0026#39; \\  --data \u0026#39;{\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;:1,\u0026#34;jsonrpc\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;2.0\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;method\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;eth_call\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;params\u0026#34;:[\u0026#39;\u0026#34;$params\u0026#34;\u0026#39;,\u0026#34;latest\u0026#34;]}\u0026#39; \\  http://127.0.0.1:8545 {\u0026#34;jsonrpc\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;2.0\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;:1,\u0026#34;result\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000011153ce5e56cf880000\u0026#34;}  The \u0026ldquo;to\u0026rdquo; address is the USDC token. It\u0026rsquo;s printed by the deployment script and it can be different in your case.\n Ethereum nodes return results as raw bytes, to parse them we need to know the type of a returned value. In the case of balanceOf function, the type of a returned value is uint256. Using cast, we can convert it to a decimal number and then convert it to ethers:\n$ cast --to-dec 0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000011153ce5e56cf880000| cast --from-wei 5042.000000000000000000 The balance is correct! We minted 42 USDC to our address.\nCurrent Tick and Price #  The above example is a demonstration of low-level contract calls. Usually, you never do calls via curl and use a tool or library that makes it easier. And Cast can help us here again!\nLet\u0026rsquo;s get the current price and tick of a pool using cast:\n$ cast call POOL_ADDRESS \u0026#34;slot0()\u0026#34;| xargs cast --abi-decode \u0026#34;a()(uint160,int24)\u0026#34; 5602277097478614198912276234240 85176 Nice! The first value is the current $\\sqrt{P}$ and the second value is the current tick.\n Since --abi-decode requires full function signature we have to specify \u0026ldquo;a()\u0026rdquo; even though we only want to decode function output.\n ABI #  To simplify interaction with contracts, Solidity compiler can output ABI, Application Binary Interface.\nABI is a JSON file that contains the description of all public methods and events of a contract. The goal of this file is to make it easier to encode function parameters and decode return values. To get ABI with Forge, use this command:\n$ forge inspect UniswapV3Pool abi Feel free skimming through the file to better understand its content.\n"},{"id":35,"href":"/docs/milestone_2/generalize-swapping/","title":"Generalize Swapping","section":"Milestone 2.

Before updating the code, we need to understand how the algorithm of swapping in Uniswap V3 works.\nYou can think of a swap as of filling of an order: a user submits an order to buy a specified amount of tokens from a pool. The pool will use the available liquidity to \u0026ldquo;convert\u0026rdquo; the input amount into an output amount of the other token. If there\u0026rsquo;s not enough liquidity in the current price range, it\u0026rsquo;ll try to find liquidity in other price ranges (using the function we implemented in the previous chapter).\nWe\u0026rsquo;re now going to implement this logic in the swap function, however going to stay only within the current price range for now–we\u0026rsquo;ll implement cross-tick swaps in the next milestone.\nfunction swap(  address recipient,  bool zeroForOne,  uint256 amountSpecified,  bytes calldata data ) public returns (int256 amount0, int256 amount1) {  ... In swap function, we add two new parameters: zeroForOne and amountSpecified. zeroForOne is the flag that controls swap direction: when true, token0 is traded in for token1; when false, it\u0026rsquo;s the opposite. For example, if token0 is ETH and token1 is USDC, setting zeroForOne to true means buying USDC for ETH. amountSpecified is the amount of tokens user wants to sell.\nFilling Orders #  Since, in Uniswap V3, liquidity is stored in multiple price ranges, Pool contract needs to find all liquidity that\u0026rsquo;s required to \u0026ldquo;fill an order\u0026rdquo; from user. This is done via iterating over initialized ticks in a direction chosen by user.\nBefore continuing, we need to define two new structures:\nstruct SwapState {  uint256 amountSpecifiedRemaining;  uint256 amountCalculated;  uint160 sqrtPriceX96;  int24 tick; }  struct StepState {  uint160 sqrtPriceStartX96;  int24 nextTick;  uint160 sqrtPriceNextX96;  uint256 amountIn;  uint256 amountOut; } SwapState maintains current swap\u0026rsquo;s state. amountSpecifiedRemaining tracks the remaining amount of tokens that needs to be bought by the pool. When it\u0026rsquo;s zero, the swap is done. amountCalculated is the out amount calculated by the contract. sqrtPriceX96 and tick are new current price and tick after a swap is done.\nStepState maintains current swap step\u0026rsquo;s state. This structure tracks the state of one iteration of an \u0026ldquo;order filling\u0026rdquo;. sqrtPriceStartX96 tracks the price the iteration begins with. nextTick is the next initialized tick that will provide liquidity for the swap and sqrtPriceNextX96 is the price at the next tick. amountIn and amountOut are amounts that can be provided by the liquidity of the current iteration.\n After we implement cross-tick swaps (that is, swaps that happen across multiple price ranges), the idea of iterating will be clearer.\n // src/UniswapV3Pool.sol  function swap(...) {  Slot0 memory slot0_ = slot0;   SwapState memory state = SwapState({  amountSpecifiedRemaining: amountSpecified,  amountCalculated: 0,  sqrtPriceX96: slot0_.sqrtPriceX96,  tick: slot0_.tick  });  ... Before filling an order, we initialize a SwapState instance. We\u0026rsquo;ll loop until amountSpecifiedRemaining is 0, which will mean that the pool has enough liquidity to buy amountSpecified tokens from user.\n... while (state.amountSpecifiedRemaining \u0026gt; 0) {  StepState memory step;   step.sqrtPriceStartX96 = state.sqrtPriceX96;   (step.nextTick, ) = tickBitmap.nextInitializedTickWithinOneWord(  state.tick,  1,  zeroForOne  );   step.sqrtPriceNextX96 = TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(step.nextTick); In the loop, we set up a price range that should provide liquidity for the swap. The range is from state.sqrtPriceX96 to step.sqrtPriceNextX96, where the latter is the price at the next initialized tick (as returned by nextInitializedTickWithinOneWord–we know this function from a previous chapter).\n(state.sqrtPriceX96, step.amountIn, step.amountOut) = SwapMath  .computeSwapStep(  state.sqrtPriceX96,  step.sqrtPriceNextX96,  liquidity,  state.amountSpecifiedRemaining  ); Next, we\u0026rsquo;re calculating the amounts that can be provider by the current price range, and the new current price the swap will result in.\n state.amountSpecifiedRemaining -= step.amountIn;  state.amountCalculated += step.amountOut;  state.tick = TickMath.getTickAtSqrtRatio(state.sqrtPriceX96); } Final steps in the loop is updating the SwapState. step.amountIn is the amount of tokens the price range can buy from user; step.amountOut is the related number of the other token the pool can sell to user. state.sqrtPriceX96 is the current price that will be set after the swap (recall that trading changes current price).\nSwapMath Contract #  Let\u0026rsquo;s look closer at SwapMath.computeSwapStep.\n// src/lib/SwapMath.sol function computeSwapStep(  uint160 sqrtPriceCurrentX96,  uint160 sqrtPriceTargetX96,  uint128 liquidity,  uint256 amountRemaining )  internal  pure  returns (  uint160 sqrtPriceNextX96,  uint256 amountIn,  uint256 amountOut  ) {  ... This is the core logic of swapping. The function calculates swap amounts within one price range and respecting available liquidity. It\u0026rsquo;ll return: the new current price and input and output token amounts. Even though the input amount is provided by user, we still calculate it to know how much of the user specified input amount was processed by one call to computeSwapStep.\nbool zeroForOne = sqrtPriceCurrentX96 \u0026gt;= sqrtPriceTargetX96;  sqrtPriceNextX96 = Math.getNextSqrtPriceFromInput(  sqrtPriceCurrentX96,  liquidity,  amountRemaining,  zeroForOne ); By checking the price, we can determine the direction of the swap. Knowing the direction, we can calculate the price after swapping amountRemaining of tokens. We\u0026rsquo;ll return to this function below.\nAfter finding the new price, we can calculate input and output amounts of the swap using the function we already have ( the same functions we used to calculate token amounts from liquidity in the mint function):\namountIn = Math.calcAmount0Delta(  sqrtPriceCurrentX96,  sqrtPriceNextX96,  liquidity ); amountOut = Math.calcAmount1Delta(  sqrtPriceCurrentX96,  sqrtPriceNextX96,  liquidity ); And swap the amounts if the direction is opposite:\nif (!zeroForOne) {  (amountIn, amountOut) = (amountOut, amountIn); } That\u0026rsquo;s it for computeSwapStep!\nFinding Price by Swap Amount #  Let\u0026rsquo;s now look at Math.getNextSqrtPriceFromInput–the function calculates a $\\sqrt{P}$ given another $\\sqrt{P}$, liquidity, and input amount. It tells what the price will be after swapping the specified input amount of tokens, given the current price and liquidity.\nGood news is that we already know the formulas: recall how we calculated price_next in Python:\n# When amount_in is token0 price_next = int((liq * q96 * sqrtp_cur) // (liq * q96 + amount_in * sqrtp_cur)) # When amount_in is token1 price_next = sqrtp_cur + (amount_in * q96) // liq We\u0026rsquo;re going to implement this in Solidity:\n// src/lib/Math.sol function getNextSqrtPriceFromInput(  uint160 sqrtPriceX96,  uint128 liquidity,  uint256 amountIn,  bool zeroForOne ) internal pure returns (uint160 sqrtPriceNextX96) {  sqrtPriceNextX96 = zeroForOne  ? getNextSqrtPriceFromAmount0RoundingUp(  sqrtPriceX96,  liquidity,  amountIn  )  : getNextSqrtPriceFromAmount1RoundingDown(  sqrtPriceX96,  liquidity,  amountIn  ); } The function handles swapping in both directions. Since calculations are different, we\u0026rsquo;ll implement them in separate functions.\nfunction getNextSqrtPriceFromAmount0RoundingUp(  uint160 sqrtPriceX96,  uint128 liquidity,  uint256 amountIn ) internal pure returns (uint160) {  uint256 numerator = uint256(liquidity) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; FixedPoint96.RESOLUTION;  uint256 product = amountIn * sqrtPriceX96;   if (product / amountIn == sqrtPriceX96) {  uint256 denominator = numerator + product;  if (denominator \u0026gt;= numerator) {  return  uint160(  mulDivRoundingUp(numerator, sqrtPriceX96, denominator)  );  }  }   return  uint160(  divRoundingUp(numerator, (numerator / sqrtPriceX96) + amountIn)  ); } In this function, we\u0026rsquo;re implementing two formulas. At the first return, it implements the same formula we implemented in Python. This is the most precise formula, but it can overflow when multiplying amountIn by sqrtPriceX96. The formula is (we discussed it in \u0026ldquo;Output Amount Calculation\u0026rdquo;): $$\\sqrt{P_{target}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{P}L}{\\Delta x \\sqrt{P} + L}$$\nWhen it overflows, we use an alternative formula, which is less precise: $$\\sqrt{P_{target}} = \\frac{L}{\\Delta x + \\frac{L}{\\sqrt{P}}}$$\nWhich is simply the previous formula with the numerator and the denominator divided by $\\sqrt{P}$ to get rid of the multiplication in the numerator.\nThe other function has simpler math:\nfunction getNextSqrtPriceFromAmount1RoundingDown(  uint160 sqrtPriceX96,  uint128 liquidity,  uint256 amountIn ) internal pure returns (uint160) {  return  sqrtPriceX96 +  uint160((amountIn \u0026lt;\u0026lt; FixedPoint96.RESOLUTION) / liquidity); } Finishing the Swap #  Now, let\u0026rsquo;s return to the swap function and finish it.\nBy this moment, we have looped over next initialized ticks, filled amountSpecified specified by user, calculated input and amount amounts, and found new price and tick. Since, in this milestone, we\u0026rsquo;re implementing only swaps within one price range, this is enough. We now need to update contract\u0026rsquo;s state, send tokens to user, and get tokens in exchange.\nif (state.tick != slot0_.tick) {  (slot0.sqrtPriceX96, slot0.tick) = (state.sqrtPriceX96, state.tick); } First, we set new price and tick. Since this operation writes to contract\u0026rsquo;s storage, we want to do it only if the new tick is different, to optimize gas consumption.\n(amount0, amount1) = zeroForOne  ? (  int256(amountSpecified - state.amountSpecifiedRemaining),  -int256(state.amountCalculated)  )  : (  -int256(state.amountCalculated),  int256(amountSpecified - state.amountSpecifiedRemaining)  ); Next, we calculate swap amounts based on swap direction and the amounts calculated during the swap loop.\nif (zeroForOne) {  IERC20(token1).transfer(recipient, uint256(-amount1));   uint256 balance0Before = balance0();  IUniswapV3SwapCallback(msg.sender).uniswapV3SwapCallback(  amount0,  amount1,  data  );  if (balance0Before + uint256(amount0) \u0026gt; balance0())  revert InsufficientInputAmount(); } else {  IERC20(token0).transfer(recipient, uint256(-amount0));   uint256 balance1Before = balance1();  IUniswapV3SwapCallback(msg.sender).uniswapV3SwapCallback(  amount0,  amount1,  data  );  if (balance1Before + uint256(amount1) \u0026gt; balance1())  revert InsufficientInputAmount(); } Next, we\u0026rsquo;re exchanging tokens with user, depending on swap direction. This piece is identical to what we had in Milestone 2, only handling of the other swap direction was added.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it! Swapping is done!\nTesting #  Test won\u0026rsquo;t change significantly, we only need to pass amountSpecified and zeroForOne to swap function. Output amount will change insignificantly though, because it\u0026rsquo;s now calculated in Solidity.\nWe can now test swapping in the opposite direction! I\u0026rsquo;ll leave this for you, as a homework (just be sure to choose a small input amount so the whole swap can be handled by our single price range). Don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate peeking at my tests if this feels difficult!\n"},{"id":36,"href":"/docs/milestone_4/tick-rounding/","title":"Tick Rounding","section":"Milestone 4.

For example, for tick spacing 60 we can have ticks: 0, 60, 120, 180, etc. Thus, when user picks a range, we need to \u0026ldquo;round\u0026rdquo; it so its boundaries are multiples of pool\u0026rsquo;s tick spacing.\nnearestUsableTick in JavaScript #  In the Uniswap V3 SDK, the function that does that is called nearestUsableTick:\n/** * Returns the closest tick that is nearest a given tick and usable for the given tick spacing * @param tick the target tick * @param tickSpacing the spacing of the pool */ export function nearestUsableTick(tick: number, tickSpacing: number) {  invariant(Number.isInteger(tick) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; Number.isInteger(tickSpacing), \u0026#39;INTEGERS\u0026#39;)  invariant(tickSpacing \u0026gt; 0, \u0026#39;TICK_SPACING\u0026#39;)  invariant(tick \u0026gt;= TickMath.MIN_TICK \u0026amp;\u0026amp; tick \u0026lt;= TickMath.MAX_TICK, \u0026#39;TICK_BOUND\u0026#39;)  const rounded = Math.round(tick / tickSpacing) * tickSpacing  if (rounded \u0026lt; TickMath.MIN_TICK) return rounded + tickSpacing  else if (rounded \u0026gt; TickMath.MAX_TICK) return rounded - tickSpacing  else return rounded } At its core, it\u0026rsquo;s just:\nMath.round(tick / tickSpacing) * tickSpacing Where Math.round is rounding to the nearest integer: when the fractional part is less than 0.5, it rounds to the lower integer; when it\u0026rsquo;s greater than 0.5 it rounds to the greater integer; and when it\u0026rsquo;s 0.5, it rounds to the greater integer as well.\nSo, in the web app, we\u0026rsquo;ll use nearestUsableTick when building mint parameters:\nconst mintParams = {  tokenA: pair.token0.address,  tokenB: pair.token1.address,  tickSpacing: pair.tickSpacing,  lowerTick: nearestUsableTick(lowerTick, pair.tickSpacing),  upperTick: nearestUsableTick(upperTick, pair.tickSpacing),  amount0Desired, amount1Desired, amount0Min, amount1Min }  In reality, it should be called whenever user adjusts a price range because we want the user to see the actual price that will be created. In our simplified app, we do it less user-friendly.\n However, we also want to have a similar function in Solidity tests, but neither of the math libraries we\u0026rsquo;re using implements it.\nnearestUsableTick in Solidity #  In our smart contract tests, we need a way to round ticks and convert rounded prices to sqrtP. In a previous chapter, we chose to use ABDKMath64x64 to handle fixed-point numbers math in tests. The library, however, doesn\u0026rsquo;t implement the rounding function we need to port nearestUsableTick, so we\u0026rsquo;ll need to implement it ourselves:\nfunction divRound(int128 x, int128 y)  internal  pure  returns (int128 result) {  int128 quot = ABDKMath64x64.div(x, y);  result = quot \u0026gt;\u0026gt; 64;   // Check if remainder is greater than 0.5  if (quot % 2**64 \u0026gt;= 0x8000000000000000) {  result += 1;  } } The function does multiple things:\n it divides two Q64.64 numbers; it then rounds the result to the decimal one (result = quot \u0026gt;\u0026gt; 64), the fractional part is lost at this point (i.e. the result is rounded down); it then divides the quotient by $2^{64}$, takes the remainder, and compares it with 0x8000000000000000 (which is 0.5 in Q64.64); if the remainder is greater or equal to 0.5, it rounds the result to the greater integer.  What we get is an integer rounded according to the rules of Math.round from JavaScript. We can then re-implement nearestUsableTick:\nfunction nearestUsableTick(int24 tick_, uint24 tickSpacing)  internal  pure  returns (int24 result) {  result =  int24(divRound(int128(tick_), int128(int24(tickSpacing)))) *  int24(tickSpacing);   if (result \u0026lt; TickMath.MIN_TICK) {  result += int24(tickSpacing);  } else if (result \u0026gt; TickMath.MAX_TICK) {  result -= int24(tickSpacing);  } } That\u0026rsquo;s it!\n"},{"id":37,"href":"/docs/milestone_5/user-interface/","title":"User Interface","section":"Milestone 5.

Cross-tick Swaps","content":"Flash Loans #  Both Uniswap V2 and V3 implement flash loans: unlimited and uncollateralized loans that must be repaid in the same transaction. Pools basically give users arbitrary amounts of tokens that they request, but, by the end of the call, the amounts must be repaid, with a small fee on top.\nThe fact that flash loans must be repaid in the same transaction means that flash loans cannot be taken by regular users: as a user, you cannot program custom logic in transactions. Flash loans can only be taken and repaid by smart contracts.\nFlash loans is a powerful financial instrument in DeFi. While it\u0026rsquo;s often used to exploit vulnerabilities in DeFi protocols (by inflating pool balances and abusing flawed state management), it\u0026rsquo;s has many good applications (e.g. leveraged positions management on lending protocols)–this is why DeFi applications that store liquidity provide permissionless flash loans.\nImplementing Flash Loans #  In Uniswap V2 flash loans were part of the swapping functionality: it was possible to borrow tokens during a swap, but you had to return them or an equal amount of the other pool token, in the same transaction. In V3, flash loans are separated from swapping–it\u0026rsquo;s simply a function that gives the caller an amount of tokens they requested, calls a callback on the caller, and ensures a flash loan was repaid:\nfunction flash(  uint256 amount0,  uint256 amount1,  bytes calldata data ) public {  uint256 balance0Before = IERC20(token0).balanceOf(address(this));  uint256 balance1Before = IERC20(token1).balanceOf(address(this));   if (amount0 \u0026gt; 0) IERC20(token0).transfer(msg.sender, amount0);  if (amount1 \u0026gt; 0) IERC20(token1).transfer(msg.sender, amount1);   IUniswapV3FlashCallback(msg.sender).uniswapV3FlashCallback(data);   require(IERC20(token0).balanceOf(address(this)) \u0026gt;= balance0Before);  require(IERC20(token1).balanceOf(address(this)) \u0026gt;= balance1Before);   emit Flash(msg.sender, amount0, amount1); } The function sends tokens to the caller and then calls uniswapV3FlashCallback on it–this is where the caller is expected to repay the loan. Then the function ensures that its balances haven\u0026rsquo;t decreased. Notice that custom data is allowed to be passed to the callback.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example of the callback implementation:\nfunction uniswapV3FlashCallback(bytes calldata data) public {  (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) = abi.decode(  data,  (uint256, uint256)  );   if (amount0 \u0026gt; 0) token0.transfer(msg.sender, amount0);  if (amount1 \u0026gt; 0) token1.transfer(msg.sender, amount1); } In this implementation, we\u0026rsquo;re simply sending tokens back to the pool (I used this callback in flash function tests). In reality, it can use the loaned amounts to perform some operations on other DeFi protocols. But it always must repay the loan in this callback.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s it!\n"},{"id":39,"href":"/docs/milestone_2/quoter-contract/","title":"Quoter Contract","section":"Milestone 2. Second Swap","content":"Quoter Contract #  To integrate our updated Pool contract into the front end app, we need a way to calculate swap amounts without making a swap. Users will type in the amount they want to sell, and we want to calculate and show them the amount they\u0026rsquo;ll get in exchange. We\u0026rsquo;ll do this through Quoter contract.\nSince liquidity in Uniswap V3 is scattered over multiple price ranges, we cannot calculate swap amounts with a formula (which was possible in Uniswap V2). The design of Uniswap V3 forces us to use a different approach: to calculate swap amounts, we\u0026rsquo;ll initiate a real swap and will interrupt it in the callback function, grabbing the amounts calculated by Pool contract. That is, we have to simulate a real swap to calculate output amount!\nAgain, we\u0026rsquo;ll make a helper contract for that:\ncontract UniswapV3Quoter {  struct QuoteParams {  address pool;  uint256 amountIn;  bool zeroForOne;  }   function quote(QuoteParams memory params)  public  returns (  uint256 amountOut,  uint160 sqrtPriceX96After,  int24 tickAfter  )  {  ... Quoter is a contract that implements only one public function–quote. Quoter is a universal contract that works with any pool so it takes pool address as a parameter. The other parameters (amountIn and zeroForOne) are required to simulate a swap.\ntry  IUniswapV3Pool(params.pool).swap(  address(this),  params.zeroForOne,  params.amountIn,  abi.encode(params.pool)  ) {} catch (bytes memory reason) {  return abi.decode(reason, (uint256, uint160, int24)); } The only thing that the contract does is calling swap function of a pool. The call is expected to revert (i.e. throw an error)–we\u0026rsquo;ll do this in the swap callback. In the case of a revert, revert reason is decoded and returned; quote will never revert. Notice that, in the extra data, we\u0026rsquo;re passing only pool address–in the swap callback, we\u0026rsquo;ll use it to get pool\u0026rsquo;s slot0 after a swap.\nfunction uniswapV3SwapCallback(  int256 amount0Delta,  int256 amount1Delta,  bytes memory data ) external view {  address pool = abi.decode(data, (address));   uint256 amountOut = amount0Delta \u0026gt; 0  ? uint256(-amount1Delta)  : uint256(-amount0Delta);   (uint160 sqrtPriceX96After, int24 tickAfter) = IUniswapV3Pool(pool)  .slot0(); In the swap callback, we\u0026rsquo;re collecting values that we need: output amount, new price, and corresponding tick. Next, we need to save these values and revert:\nassembly {  let ptr := mload(0x40)  mstore(ptr, amountOut)  mstore(add(ptr, 0x20), sqrtPriceX96After)  mstore(add(ptr, 0x40), tickAfter)  revert(ptr, 96) } For gas optimization, this piece is implemented in Yul, the language used for inline assembly in Solidity. Let\u0026rsquo;s break it down:\n mload(0x40) reads the pointer of the next available memory slot (memory in EVM is organized in 32 byte slots); at that memory slot, mstore(ptr, amountOut) writes amountOut; mstore(add(ptr, 0x20), sqrtPriceX96After) writes sqrtPriceX96After right after amountOut; mstore(add(ptr, 0x40), tickAfter) writes tickAfter after sqrtPriceX96After; revert(ptr, 96) reverts the call and returns 96 bytes (total length of the values we wrote to memory) of data at address ptr (start of the data we wrote above).  So, we\u0026rsquo;re basically concatenating the bytes representations of the values we need (exactly what abi.encode() does). Notice that the offsets are always 32 bytes, even though sqrtPriceX96After takes 20 bytes (uint160) and tickAfter takes 3 bytes (int24). This is so we could use abi.decode() to decode the data: its counterpart, abi.encode(), encodes all integers as 32-byte words.\nAaaand, done.\nRecap #  Let\u0026rsquo;s recap to better understand the algorithm:\n quote calls swap of a pool with input amount and swap direction; swap performs a real swap, it runs the loop to fill the input amount specified by user; to get tokens from user, swap calls the swap callback on the caller; the caller (Quote contract) implements the callback, in which it reverts with output amount, new price, and new tick; the revert bubbles up to the initial quote call; in quote, the revert is caught, revert reason is decoded and returned as the result of calling quote.  I hope this is clear!\nQuoter Limitation #  This design has one significant limitation: since quote calls swap function of Pool contract, and swap function is not a pure or view function (because it modifies contract state), quote cannot also be pure or view. swap modifies state and so does quote, even if not in Quoter contract. But we treat quote as a getter, a function that only reads contract data. This inconsistency means that EVM will use CALL opcode instead of CALLSTATIC when quote is called. This is not a big problem since Quoter reverts in the swap callback, and reverting resets the state modified during a call–this guarantees that quote won\u0026rsquo;t modify the state of Pool contract (no actual trade will happen).\nAnother inconvenience that comes from this issue is that calling quote from a client library (Ethers.js, Web3.js, etc.) will trigger a transaction. To fix this, we\u0026rsquo;ll need to force the library to make a static call.

Instead, I\u0026rsquo;ll show how to use MetaMask to interact with smart contracts.\n If you want to experiment with the app and run it locally, you can fund it in the ui folder in the code repo. This is a simple React app, to run it locally set contracts addresses in App.js and run yarn start.\n Overview of Tools #  What is MetaMask? #  MetaMask is an Ethereum wallet implemented as a browser extension. It creates and stores private keys, shows token balances, allows to connect to different networks, sends, and receives ether and tokens–everything a wallet has to do.\nBesides that, MetaMask acts as a signer and a provider. As a provider, it connects to an Ethereum node and provides an interface to use its JSON-RPC API. As a signer, it provides an interface for secure transaction signing, thus it can be used to sign any transaction using a private key from the wallet.\nConvenience Libraries #  MetaMask, however, doesn\u0026rsquo;t provide much functionality: it can only manage accounts and send raw transactions. We need another library that will make interaction with contracts easy. And we also want a set of utilities that will make our life easier when handling EVM-specific data (ABI encoding/decoding, big numbers handling, etc.).\nThere are multiple such libraries. The two most popular ones are: web3.js and ethers.js. Picking either of them is a matter of personal preference. To me, Ethers.js seems to have a cleaner contract interaction interface, so I\u0026rsquo;ll pick it.\nWorkflows #  Let\u0026rsquo;s now see how we can implement interaction scenarios using MetaMask + Ethers.js.\nConnecting to Local Node #  To send transactions and fetch blockchain data, MetaMask connects to an Ethereum node. To interact with our contracts, we need to connect to the local Anvil node. To do this, open MetaMask, click on the list of networks, click \u0026ldquo;Add Network\u0026rdquo;, and add a network with RPC URL http://localhost:8545. It\u0026rsquo;ll automatically detect the chain ID (31337 in the case of Anvil).\nAfter connecting to the local node, we need to import our private key. In MetaMask, click on the list of addresses, click \u0026ldquo;Import Account\u0026rdquo;, and paste the private key of the address you picked before deploying the contracts. After that, go to the assets list and import the addresses of the two tokens. Now you should see balances of the tokens in MetaMask.\n MetaMask is still somewhat bugged. One problem I struggled with is that it caches blockchain state when connected to localhost. Because of this, when restarting the node, you might see old token balances and state. To fix this, go to the advanced settings and click \u0026ldquo;Reset Account\u0026rdquo;. You\u0026rsquo;ll need to do this each time after restarting the node.\n Connecting to MetaMask #  Not every website is allowed to get access to your address in MetaMask. A website first needs to connect to MetaMask. When a new website is connecting to MetaMask, you\u0026rsquo;ll see a window that asks for permissions.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how to connect to MetaMask from a front-end app:\n// ui/src/contexts/MetaMask.js const connect = () =\u0026gt; {  if (typeof (window.ethereum) === \u0026#39;undefined\u0026#39;) {  return setStatus(\u0026#39;not_installed\u0026#39;);  }   Promise.all([  window.ethereum.request({ method: \u0026#39;eth_requestAccounts\u0026#39; }),  window.ethereum.request({ method: \u0026#39;eth_chainId\u0026#39; }),  ]).then(function ([accounts, chainId]) {  setAccount(accounts[0]);  setChain(chainId);  setStatus(\u0026#39;connected\u0026#39;);  })  .catch(function (error) {  console.error(error)  }); } window.ethereum is an object provided by MetaMask, it\u0026rsquo;s the interface to communicate with MetaMask. If it\u0026rsquo;s undefined, MetaMask is not installed. If it\u0026rsquo;s defined, we can send two requests to MetaMask: eth_requestAccounts and eth_chainId. In fact, eth_requestAccounts connects a website to MetaMask. It basically queries an address from MetaMask, and MetaMask asks for permission from user. User will be able to choose which addresses to give access to.\neth_chainId will ask for the chain ID of the node MetaMask is connected to. After obtaining an address and chain ID, it\u0026rsquo;s a good practice to display them in the interface:\nProviding Liquidity #  To provide liquidity into the pool, we need to build a form that asks the user to type the amounts they want to deposit. After clicking \u0026ldquo;Submit\u0026rdquo;, the app will build a transaction that calls mint in the manager contract and provides the amounts chosen by users. Let\u0026rsquo;s see how to do this.\nEther.js provides Contract interface to interact with contracts. It makes our life much easier, since it takes on the job of encoding function parameters, creating a valid transaction, and handing it over to MetaMask. For us, calling contracts looks like calling asynchronous methods on a JS object.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s see how to create an instance of Contracts:\ntoken0 = new ethers.Contract(  props.config.token0Address,  props.config.ABIs.ERC20,  new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum).getSigner() ); A Contract instance is an address and the ABI of the contract deployed at this address. The ABI is needed to interact with the contract. The third parameter is the signer interface provided by MetaMask–it\u0026rsquo;s used by the JS contract instance to sign transactions via MetaMask.\nNow, let\u0026rsquo;s add a function for adding liquidity to the pool:\nconst addLiquidity = (account, { token0, token1, manager }, { managerAddress, poolAddress }) =\u0026gt; {  const amount0 = ethers.utils.parseEther(\u0026#34;0.998976618347425280\u0026#34;);  const amount1 = ethers.utils.parseEther(\u0026#34;5000\u0026#34;); // 5000 USDC  const lowerTick = 84222;  const upperTick = 86129;  const liquidity = ethers.BigNumber.from(\u0026#34;1517882343751509868544\u0026#34;);  const extra = ethers.utils.defaultAbiCoder.encode(  [\u0026#34;address\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;address\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;address\u0026#34;],  [token0.address, token1.address, account]  );  ... The first thing to do is to prepare the parameters. We use the same values we calculated earlier.\nNext, we allow the manager contract to take our tokens. First, we check the current allowances:\nPromise.all(  [  token0.allowance(account, managerAddress),  token1.allowance(account, managerAddress)  ] ) Then, we check if either of them is enough to transfer a corresponding amount of tokens. If not, we\u0026rsquo;re sending an approve transaction, which asks the user to approve spending of a specific amount to the manager contract. After ensuring that the user has approved full amounts, we call manager.mint to add liquidity:\n.then(([allowance0, allowance1]) =\u0026gt; {  return Promise.resolve()  .then(() =\u0026gt; {  if (allowance0.lt(amount0)) {  return token0.approve(managerAddress, amount0).then(tx =\u0026gt; tx.wait())  }  })  .then(() =\u0026gt; {  if (allowance1.lt(amount1)) {  return token1.approve(managerAddress, amount1).then(tx =\u0026gt; tx.wait())  }  })  .then(() =\u0026gt; {  return manager.mint(poolAddress, lowerTick, upperTick, liquidity, extra)  .then(tx =\u0026gt; tx.wait())  })  .then(() =\u0026gt; {  alert(\u0026#39;Liquidity added!\u0026#39;);  }); })  lt is a method of BigNumber. Ethers.js uses BigNumber to represent uint256 type, for which JavaScript doesn\u0026rsquo;t have enough precision. This is one of the reasons why we want a convenience library.\n This is pretty much similar to the test contract, besides the allowances part.\ntoken0, token1, and manager in the above code are instances of Contract. approve and mint are contract functions, which were generated dynamically from the ABIs we provided when instantiated the contracts. When calling these methods, Ethers.js:\n encodes function parameters; builds a transaction; passes the transaction to MetaMask and asks to sign it; user sees a MetaMask window and presses \u0026ldquo;Confirm\u0026rdquo;; sends the transaction to the node MetaMask is connected to; returns a transaction object with full information about the sent transaction.  The transaction object also contains wait function, which we call to wait for a transaction to be mined–this allows us to wait for a transaction to be successfully executed before sending another.\n Ethereum requires a strict order of transaction. Remember the nonce? It\u0026rsquo;s an account-wide index of transactions, sent by this account. Every new transaction increases this index, and Ethereum won\u0026rsquo;t mine a transaction until a previous transaction (one with a smaller nonce) was mined.\n Swapping Tokens #  To swap tokens, we use the same pattern: get parameters from the user, check allowance, call swap on the manager.\nconst swap = (amountIn, account, { tokenIn, manager, token0, token1 }, { managerAddress, poolAddress }) =\u0026gt; {  const amountInWei = ethers.utils.parseEther(amountIn);  const extra = ethers.utils.defaultAbiCoder.encode(  [\u0026#34;address\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;address\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;address\u0026#34;],  [token0.address, token1.address, account]  );   tokenIn.allowance(account, managerAddress)  .then((allowance) =\u0026gt; {  if (allowance.lt(amountInWei)) {  return tokenIn.approve(managerAddress, amountInWei).then(tx =\u0026gt; tx.wait())  }  })  .then(() =\u0026gt; {  return manager.swap(poolAddress, extra).then(tx =\u0026gt; tx.wait())  })  .then(() =\u0026gt; {  alert(\u0026#39;Swap succeeded!\u0026#39;);  }).catch((err) =\u0026gt; {  console.error(err);  alert(\u0026#39;Failed!\u0026#39;);  }); } The only new thing here is ethers.utils.parseEther() function, which we use to convert numbers to wei, the smallest unit in Ethereum.\nSubscribing to Changes #  For a decentralized application, it\u0026rsquo;s important to reflect the current blockchain state. For example, in the case of a decentralized exchange, it\u0026rsquo;s critical to properly calculate swap prices based on current pool reserves; outdated data can cause slippage and make a swap transaction fail.\nWhile developing the pool contract, we learned about events, which act as blockchain data indexes: whenever smart contract state is modified, it\u0026rsquo;s a good practice to emit an event since events are indexed for quick search. What we\u0026rsquo;re going to do now, is to subscribe to contract events to keep our front-end app updated. Let\u0026rsquo;s build an event feed!\nIf you checked the ABI file as I recommended earlier, you saw that it also contains description of events: event name and its fields. Well, Ether.js parses them and provides an interface to subscribe to new events. Let\u0026rsquo;s see how this works.\nTo subscribe to events, we\u0026rsquo;ll use on(EVENT_NAME, handler) function. The callback receives all the fields of the event and the event itself as parameters:\nconst subscribeToEvents = (pool, callback) =\u0026gt; {  pool.on(\u0026#34;Mint\u0026#34;, (sender, owner, tickLower, tickUpper, amount, amount0, amount1, event) =\u0026gt; callback(event));  pool.on(\u0026#34;Swap\u0026#34;, (sender, recipient, amount0, amount1, sqrtPriceX96, liquidity, tick, event) =\u0026gt; callback(event)); } To filter and fetch previous events, we can use queryFilter:\nPromise.all([  pool.queryFilter(\u0026#34;Mint\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;earliest\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;latest\u0026#34;),  pool.queryFilter(\u0026#34;Swap\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;earliest\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;latest\u0026#34;), ]).then(([mints, swaps]) =\u0026gt; {  ... }); You probably noticed that some event fields are marked as indexed–such fields are indexed by Ethereum nodes, which lets search events by specific values in such fields. For example, the Swap event has sender and recipient fields indexed, so we can search by swap sender and recipient. And again, Ethere.js makes this easier:\nconst swapFilter = pool.filters.Swap(sender, recipient); const swaps = await pool.queryFilter(swapFilter, fromBlock, toBlock);  And that\u0026rsquo;s it! We\u0026rsquo;re done with milestone 1!\n🎉🍾🍾🍾🎉 "},{"id":41,"href":"/docs/milestone_2/user-interface/","title":"User Interface","section":"Milestone 2. Second Swap","content":"User Interface #  Let\u0026rsquo;s make our web app work more like a real DEX. We can now remove hardcoded swap amounts and let users type arbitrary amounts. Moreover, we can now let users swap in both direction, so we also need a button to swap the token inputs. After updating, the swap form will look like:\n\u0026lt;form className=\u0026#34;SwapForm\u0026#34;\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;SwapInput  amount={zeroForOne ? amount0 : amount1}  disabled={!enabled || loading}  readOnly={false}  setAmount={setAmount_(zeroForOne ? setAmount0 : setAmount1, zeroForOne)}  token={zeroForOne ? pair[0] : pair[1]} /\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;ChangeDirectionButton zeroForOne={zeroForOne} setZeroForOne={setZeroForOne} disabled={!enabled || loading} /\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;SwapInput  amount={zeroForOne ? amount1 : amount0}  disabled={!enabled || loading}  readOnly={true}  token={zeroForOne ? pair[1] : pair[0]} /\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;button className=\u0026#39;swap\u0026#39; disabled={!enabled || loading} onClick={swap_}\u0026gt;Swap\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/form\u0026gt; Each input has an amount assigned to it depending on swap direction controlled by zeroForOne state variable. The lower input field is always read-only because its value is calculated by Quoter contract.\nsetAmount_ function does two things: it updates the value of the top input and calls Quoter contract to calculate the value of the lower input:\nconst updateAmountOut = debounce((amount) =\u0026gt; {  if (amount === 0 || amount === \u0026#34;0\u0026#34;) {  return;  }   setLoading(true);   quoter.callStatic  .quote({ pool: config.poolAddress, amountIn: ethers.utils.parseEther(amount), zeroForOne: zeroForOne })  .then(({ amountOut }) =\u0026gt; {  zeroForOne ? setAmount1(ethers.utils.formatEther(amountOut)) : setAmount0(ethers.utils.formatEther(amountOut));  setLoading(false);  })  .catch((err) =\u0026gt; {  zeroForOne ? setAmount1(0) : setAmount0(0);  setLoading(false);  console.error(err);  }) })  const setAmount_ = (setAmountFn) =\u0026gt; {  return (amount) =\u0026gt; {  amount = amount || 0;  setAmountFn(amount);  updateAmountOut(amount)  } } Notice the callStatic called on quoter–this is what we discussed in the previous chapter: we need to force Ethers.js to make a static call. Since quote is not a pure or view function, Ethers.js will try to call quote in a transaction.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s it! The UI now allows to specify arbitrary amounts and swap in either direction!\n"},{"id":42,"href":"/docs/milestone_3/user-interface/","title":"User Interface","section":"Milestone 3.

We\u0026rsquo;ll add two new features:\n Add Liquidity dialog window; slippage tolerance in swapping.  Add Liquidity Dialog #  This change will finally remove hard coded liquidity amounts from our code and will allow use to add liquidity at arbitrary ranges.\nThe dialog is a simple component with a couple of inputs. We can even re-use addLiquidity function from previous implementation. However, now we need to convert prices to tick indices in JavaScript: we want users to type in prices but the contracts expect ticks. To make our job easier, we\u0026rsquo;ll use the official Uniswap V3 SDK for that.\nTo convert price to $\\sqrt{P}$, we can use encodeSqrtRatioX96 function. The function takes two amounts as input and calculates a price by dividing one by the other. Since we only want to convert $\\sqrt{P}$ to price, we can pass 1 as amount0:\nconst priceToSqrtP = (price) =\u0026gt; encodeSqrtRatioX96(price, 1); To convert price to tick index, we can use TickMath.getTickAtSqrtRatio function. This is an implementation of the Solidity TickMath library in JavaScript:\nconst priceToTick = (price) =\u0026gt; TickMath.getTickAtSqrtRatio(priceToSqrtP(price)); So we can now convert prices typed in by users to ticks:\nconst lowerTick = priceToTick(lowerPrice); const upperTick = priceToTick(upperPrice); Another thing we need to add here is slippage protection. For simplicity, I made it a hard coded value and set it to 0.5%. Here\u0026rsquo;s how to use slippage tolerance to calculate minimal amounts:\nconst slippage = 0.5; const amount0Desired = ethers.utils.parseEther(amount0); const amount1Desired = ethers.utils.parseEther(amount1); const amount0Min = amount0Desired.mul((100 - slippage) * 100).div(10000); const amount1Min = amount1Desired.mul((100 - slippage) * 100).div(10000); Slippage Tolerance in Swapping #  Even though we\u0026rsquo;re the only user of the application and thus will never have problems with slippage during development, let\u0026rsquo;s add an input to control slippage tolerance during swaps.\nWhen swapping, slippage protection is implemented via limiting price–a price we don\u0026rsquo;t to go above or below during a swap. This means that we need to know this price before sending a swap transaction. However, we don\u0026rsquo;t need to calculate it on the front end because Quoter contract does this for us:\nfunction quote(QuoteParams memory params)  public  returns (  uint256 amountOut,  uint160 sqrtPriceX96After,  int24 tickAfter  ) { ... } And we\u0026rsquo;re calling Quoter to calculate swap amounts.\nSo, to calculate limiting price we need to take sqrtPriceX96After and subtract slippage tolerance from it–this will be the price we don\u0026rsquo;t want to go below during a swap.\nconst limitPrice = priceAfter.mul((100 - parseFloat(slippage)) * 100).div(10000); And that\u0026rsquo;s it!\n"}]
