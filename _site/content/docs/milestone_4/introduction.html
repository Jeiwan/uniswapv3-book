<h1 id="multi-pool-swaps">Multi-pool Swaps</h1>

<p>After implementing cross-tick swaps, we’ve got really close to real Uniswap V3 swaps. One significant limitation of our
implementation is that it allows only swaps within a pool–if there’s no pool for a swap of tokens, then swapping between
these tokens is not possible. This is not so in Uniswap since it allows multi-pool swaps. In this chapter, we’re going
to add multi-pool swaps to our implementation. Here’s the plan:</p>

<ol>
  <li>First, we’ll learn about and implement Factory contract.</li>
  <li>Then, we’ll see how chained or multi-pool swaps work and implement Path library.</li>
  <li>Then, we’ll update the front-end app to support multi-pool swaps. At this step we’ll implement a basic router that
finds a path between two tokens.</li>
  <li>Along the way, we’ll also learn about tick spacing which is a way of optimizing swaps.</li>
  <li>After finishing this chapter, our implementation will be able to handle multi-pool swaps, for example, swapping WBTC
for WETH via different stablecoins: WETH → USDC → USDT → WBTC.</li>
</ol>
