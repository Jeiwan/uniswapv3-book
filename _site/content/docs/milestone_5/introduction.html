<h1 id="fees-and-price-oracle">Fees and Price Oracle</h1>

<p>In this milestone, we’re going to add two new features to our Uniswap implementation. They share one similarity: they
work on top of what we have already built–that’s why we’ve delayed them until this milestone. However, they’re not
equally important.</p>

<p>We’re going to add swap fees and a price oracle:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Swap fees is a crucial mechanism of the DEX design we’re implementing. They’re the glue that makes things stick
together. Swap fees incentivize liquidity providers to provide liquidity, and no trades are possible without liquidity,
as we have already learned.</li>
  <li>A price oracle, on the other hand, is an optional utility function of a DEX. A DEX, while conducting trades, can also
function as a price oracle–that is, provide token prices to other services. This doesn’t affect actual swaps but
provides a useful service to other on-chain applications.</li>
</ul>

<p>Alright, let’s get building!</p>
