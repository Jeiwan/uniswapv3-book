<p>This is the cherry on the cake of this book. In this milestone, we’re going to learn how Uniswap contract can be extended
and integrated into third-party protocols. This possibility is a direct consequence of having core contracts with only
crucial functions–this allows to integrate such core contracts into high-order contract with unexpected mechanics.</p>

<p>A bonus feature of Uniswap V3 was the ability to turn liquidity positions into NFT tokens. Here’s an example of one
such NFT tokens:</p>

<p><img src="/images/milestone_6_nft_example.png" alt="Uniswap V3 NFT example" /></p>

<p>It shows token symbols, pool fee, position ID, lower and upper ticks, token addresses, and the segment of the curve the
position is provided at.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can see all Uniswap V3 NFT positions in <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/uniswap-v3-positions">this OpenSea collection</a>.</p>

<p>Good news is that we’re going to add this feature to our implementation!</p>

<p>Let’s do it!</p>
